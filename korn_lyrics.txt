

Are you ready?!

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self esteem is low, how deep can I go, in the ground that I lay?
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.
This time I look to see what's between the lines!

I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind... [x12]
I'm blind [x4]




There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me
Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?!
Ball Tongue!
-You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me
Ball Tongue!
-The rag I'm on, we are justified
Ball Tongue!
-Congrats you just fucked up my make-up and shit
Ball Tongue!
-What have you done for me?!

Why are you at home buried in your own self pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?!
Ball Tongue!
-You have come to take from your buddy
Ball Tongue!
-You have never been so funky
Ball Tongue!
-The higgle got sick of me
Ball Tongue!
-Ahh, the dick is fine for the day
Ball Tongue!
-Your brother took it from me
Ball Tongue!
-Unidetified enemy
Ball Tongue!
-Come fucking back to save us and gave up
Ball Tongue!
-They've come to deliver me

You were my brother, Where does our friendship end? [x3]
You were my brother, I'm not going to give in

How can you fuck'n doubt me, but not again [repeated]

Ball Tongue!
-They've driven right by my friends
Ball Tongue!
-They've taken the take above me
Ball Tongue!
-You're a psycho monkey
Ball Tongue!
-They've come to enslave me
Ball Tongue!
-They've jacken themselves onto me
Ball Tongue!
-Your fuck'n gangster signs
Ball Tongue!
-They've come not to save them, but they take
Ball Tongue!
-Fuck'n death to fuck'n me

'Cause I'm a phsyco-fuck [repeated]

Ball Tongue!
-Berome's dead at the technodrome
Ball Tongue!
-You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped, but who was it?
Ball Tongue!
-It dosen't of the rhythm of the damn monger
Ball Tongue!
-Can I die?! Can I die?!
Ball Tongue!
-And then, the man kept kick'n me
Ball Tongue!
-He gets him on, they're cool
Ball Tongue!
-He wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on the head
Ball Tongue!
-No more, he's rid of you. You're a Dyke!




I, I am confused, fighting myself
Wanting to give in, needing your help
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you, but inside I'm fucked

Can you see it in me?
Skin cold from touch
Each day confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer, I push you away
You tell me it's OK, I can't help but feel the pain

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I love you!
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?
Why! Why! Why! Why!
Fuck you, bitch!
Need to [x3]... fuck [x4]...

Take away the only love inside you
I see the face through everyone 
Inside I've just begun! 
You think I'm out to scare you 
I'm only out to prepare you for when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down! 

You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine 

Tell me why you never liked me 
Tell me why it is you fight me (Tell me why, so you'll fight me)
Pull down and wait for the perfect time to take what is rightfully
mine
You think they're dumb to defy me
You said you don't want to defy me 
-You wait, to dumb run anyone (. . .you don't want anyone)
Oh well. . . 

You know what, Fuck you! 
I'm fed up with you! 
I'm not as good as you?! 
Fuck no! I'm better than you!

You try to see what you got 
Me ripping at your brain!

Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset
Walking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly. Please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay (Made the hurt stay)

All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably. You'd just throw your way...

Faget! [x2]

You faggot, if we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday
Who gives a fuck?!
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think

You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty-boy feeling
Like I'm enslaved to a world that never
Appreciated shit

Go! 

I can, in every way
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes to me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away 
It's so predictable 

I can, in every way, feel the stress that tangles up inside 
Too blind to see, emptiness and sorrow of their lives 
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties 
You ask me? 
It's so predictable 

I'm gonna try 
I'm gonna die 
I'm gonna try 

another day 
Silence overwhelms my mind 
who is to say 
If I have the time, oh why 
should I pray 
for all the hate to go away 
another day 
I can never break free 
You wait for me 
I call out to you 
Another day 
I'll live forever!




I can't stand the sight of you 
I can't stand what you put me through 
Your life's a lie, that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 
I can't stand, oh, the thought of you 
I can't stand all the things you do 
What do you try to justify? 
You were just too scared to be you inside 
Let!
It all go 

(I look) at you, all I see, is a man too afraid to really be

I can't stand what you put me through 
I can't stand even the thought of you 
Your secret lies that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 

You try so hard to be wanted 
-False emotions tells you fronted 
I feel being a person relies on one thing: 
Be yourself, let you come through 
you're too afraid to really be 
Someone who isn't false, who dosen't care to be 
Be yourself, let you come through! 

Fake! 
-You'll regret it, you'll regret it




I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Search through these problems that haunt and taunt you
I smile, while you're afraid
Your run, while you're so in pain

Do you ever see it [out from] outside your fears
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fears

I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you

I want you to see the life you have disguised
The world of things that hurt you
Kept all these useless lies
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time
I tried, you win
My life is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain!
Go!




'Ello, esta Caco
Et eres Caco
Well, you know, you fucking call me the Caco, okay?

I keep asking, what's your lie?
It is disturbing
This isn't mine
Why
Days keep passing
A lot of time
I don't feel right
Please God let me sleep tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

I keep asking
Well, again, please try
It is haunting
This takes my mind
Days keep passing
Line after line
I don't feel right
Please God don't let me die tonight,
Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

Please God, please God
Please God help me
Please God save me
Please God help me from my painful situation

Please God don't let me slip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me chip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me slip in tonight, don't let me die
Please God don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die




Mother please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
A rape in my eyes and on your flesh I'll eat

You've raped!
I feel dirty
It hurt!
As a child
Tied down!
That's a good boy
And fucked!
Your own child
I scream!
No one hears me
It hurt!
I'm not a liar
My God!
Saw you watching
Mommy why?!
Your own child

It's alright

I didn't touch you there
Mama said she didn't care
I didn't touch you there
That's why mama stopped and stared

I fucking hate you! Mother fucker!
Mother Fucker! I fucking hate you! Fuck You!
You son of a bitch, you fucking ruined my life!
I wanted to die!
I'm sick of it, mother fucker.... oh oh
Why'd you fuckin' do it to me?
I Hate You!
I Fuckin' Hate You!
I Hate You!
Why?!
I Hate You!




You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right

On top you think you're bomb artista
But you're bent out of, oh, right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're, oh, right

Sometimes things might make me
Oh, it makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
Rugged in mind a hint of bite
Why does it not exist in you?

Right, shit, why hit in yet another day
Woo hoo right
It's not woo hoo right
But you're wrong

Twist, twist, twist, twist

Put me in right, now make mad
Prove that you're right
Somehow you're not right, huh
But that don't make me mad

Right now you're beggin' for a little brew
All night
Yeah, it's so simple
I had some red dog, you hand over it

Twist, twist, twist, twist




Pain!
Buried so far away
Enter my life of nothing

Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!
Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!

I am so high, always
Burying my life so slowly

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

We enter in my head
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me
Can't you feel this pain!
reaming through my heart!
screaming through my veins!
nothing I can kill!
screaming a lie! I! Am!
Can't you feel my eyes out
Can't you take my heart. . . away
To heart
Good-bye

[chorus]




Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind, that thorn in my spine
Oh sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine

Wait! to see it before my eyes
Why! do I run away?

Looking all the time at your face so blind
Feeling uptight, always the same fight
Hey man now decide, go ahead take your time
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine

Wait! You can only see one side
Why?! Play yourself out 'dat way?
Why?! You and me always hang
Wait! Weren't you my friend?

The pain in which I could not feel!!!

Hey man look inside, now you need your own life
Remember me guy? That thorn in your spine
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine
Remember me guy? That thorn in your spine

[chorus]




Fuck yes! 
Always I'm locked in my head 
Know pain, you don't know what I have had 
By now, I'm so for sure 
Right now, I am yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me, oh hell no 

It came unknown to me 
Paranoid is controlling all of me 
Somehow, a terror so pure 
Right now, shit I'm yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me all, oh hell no 
Wasn't me, I swallow 
Forgive me, i don't know 
Oh hell no. . . 

This thing I follow 
The place, I'm too scared to fuckin' go 
A freak, that I'm sure 
A freak, that is yours 

[chorus]

Freak . . Punk ass sissy I'm a freak. . .




Pleasant things I feel...




You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways, but you left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I've dealt with all your games 
I wish you're happy now, I had to let you win 

Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my brain 

I scream without a sound 
How could you take away everything that I was? 
Leave me a fuckin slave 
Your face that I despise 
Your heart inside that's gray 
I came today to say, you're fucked in every way 

[Chorus]

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my mind 
You stole my life without a sigh 
You sucked me dry 

[Chorus]




Boomerang, Zoomerang, Doomerang, Up

the time has come to realize what you are, what you've done inside
The time has come, we'll have something to talk about
I will too

Looking back. . .dumb

This child's mind you terrorized. . . old man
You came to him. . .dumb

Looking back. . .child

[chorus]

First you told me everybody was my neighbor
they took advantage of me and then they took their turns hating me
I wish I wouldn't have watched you, I really mean it
My childhood, a failure
What a fucking neighbor

I hate you, I will too

[chorus]

Each time I dream you standin there, right by my side
Why do you make me, you take my pride 
and in my eyes you kinda rape me, inside 

I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide which I like 

Some look at the time, I looked back into my life 
You want to touch me to see what's in my eyes 
Why do you make me remember all the hate all its shame 
Don't you hate me, sometimes? 

[chorus]

I got no place to run, so don't come follow me

Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Gotta fat frown cause I'm down, so take a look around
All you see is big black boots, step in, use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet, you want to live with this nigger, to with
From here to New York I get them skins, and I ain't talking about p 
Your sly, you pig, dig 
Listen from the flow from a soul fro'ed caucasion 
Ah, who didn't know I was as funky as Wilson Picket 
but ya talkin. . . 

[chorus]

People wanna know how come I get a gat 
and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm 
Ready to bring that noise and kinda trigger happy like Ghetto
Blaster 
December 29th was power to the people, ya'll might just see a
sequence 
'Cause police got equal, hey, A horse is a pig that dosen't fly straight
I'm doin Daryl Gates but it's Willie Williams, I'm doin with the pil 
I'm threw with the pig, so I think the job is dead, get out. . . 

[chorus]




Honestly, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of
something I can never be
It doesn't bother me, 'cause I will always be that pimp I see
in all of my fantasies

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's. . .

Screwin' may be the only way that I can truly be free
from my fucked up reality
so I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause its so fun to see my
face staring back at me

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's fuck.

All Day I Dream About Sex
All Day I Dream About fuckin'

[chorus]




This is Caco!

Shhhhiiiiitt 

All my friends drive a lowrider
and the lowrider is a little lower 

Take a little trip, take a little trip, take a little trip with me

Shit. . .aww shit, aww shhhiitt, awww. . .yup. . .




I hate writing shit, it is so stupid
What's my problem today? 
Maybe I'm depressed, 
Maybe I'm not listening to what comes out my pen
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid 
Why do I feel this way? 
It is in my eye 
I'm in way too far 
Can't it won't go away 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

I hate writing shit 
Ain't looking foward to it 
What's fucked up, today? 
Writing all this time 
Feeling all that's mine 
Come right out my pen 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

Tell me now, I want to know 
Is it me inside you see? 
Ahh, it isn't fair 
I got a little son inside me. . .free. . . 

Set me free 
It just sets me free 
It just sets me free 

Before long my song is dying! 

That;s why I died, this lie, I try!!!




Lady life, don't you cry
My life, pain is God
Many nights, painfull thoughts of her
Yell at me, again I'm wrong

In denial, I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see, a hate deep inside
Startle me, someone save me

Now these memories, fill my heart, they bury me

All I wanna do!
You are not my real mother
Is kill you
Should I'd beat and stab and fuck her

Looking back I was never ever right
You were my step-mom who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walkin' in and I 'd say hello,
but you slap me and you make some fucked up comment about my
clothes
So I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head
were with you, with a knife up your ass, laying dead
so I pop some more caps in your ass,
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch! Never try to play me!!!

You made my life not so good

All I wanna do! . . . is kill you

[chorus]

Wish you were dead now!!!

How can I cry over someone I never loved?
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Never loved. . .




Come on! 
Save some for me, it's what I like. 
I wanna play, you know it's time. 
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
Come on! 
It's on! 
Now see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
Once I cave in, what can I fight? 
I can never win, my self I don't like, 
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like. 
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
Come on! 
It's on! 
You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
This time. This... time. 
For me, inside. Put me inside. 
Hold me, this time. Put me inside. 
Come on! 
It's on!




Something takes a part of me.
Something lost and never seen.
Everytime I start to believe,
Something's raped and taken from me... from me. 
Life's got to always be messing with me. (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain. (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain... in vain. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release. (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free... is free
Chorus 

Boom na da mmm dum na ema 
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema 

GO! 
So...fight! something on the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight
So...something on the... dum na ema
Fight...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
No...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight 

[Chorus]

Part of me...
Oh...




Hate, something, sometime, someway,
something kick on the front floor.
Mine? Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give.. me.. some.. thing.. that.. is.. for.. real.
I'll never ever follow.
Get your boogie on...
Hate, something, someway, each day, feeling ripped off again.
Why? This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give.. me.. noth.. ing.. just.. feel.
And now this shit will follow.
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Oh, I see
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me.
I don't feel your deathly ways.
Each day i feel so hollow, inside I was beating me,
You will never see, so come dance with me.
Dance with me
Rumbiddieboo
Rum bum dee dum dee bum diddie doo
ME!
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Got the life.
Got... the... life.




Come on, step inside, and you will realize.
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be.
What's your vision?
You'll see, what do you expect of me?
I cant live that lie. 

[Chorus:]
Hey!
I've sick mom,
With a fucked dad.
Dealing with your life.
Dead bodies everywhere. 
You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

Let me strip the plain, let me not give in.
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies.
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me.
Let me live my... life.

[Chorus]

You want me to be, something I can never ever be! [x2]

[Chorus]

Dead bodies everywhere! [x8]




[Ice Cube:]
Attention all parents!
Report to your local therapist!
Report to your local church!
Report to your local police department!
It's goin' down!

[Jonathan:]
Glaring into my sons eyes.
Reveals a void
I felt her in the day.

[Ice Cube:]
Insanity.

[Jonathan:]
It was all about the pussy, if you can get it.
A little girl like me never fucking liked it.

[Ice Cube:]
We ain't takin' no mo'! Go!

[Jonathan:]
So sing me, I, I

[Ice Cube:]
I'm not fucking around
Stop fucking with me

[Jonathan:]
And the children are born.
Your feeling through me, I, I
You're the children of the Korn.

[Ice Cube:]
Droppin' smoke in the alley, makin' noise with a
double pump,
Bring your boys turn up at a party with you
doubled up.
Double ridie, double party, hardcore, teenage,
fuckin' bitches major.
Catch me if you can, fuck the law with my dick in
my hand,
We're comin' strong.
Generation triple X, we're all about the weed
smoke and the kinky sex nigga what

[Jonathan:]
So sing me, I, I

I'm not fucking around
Stop fucking with me

[Jonathan:]
And the children are born.
Your feeling through me, I, I
We're the children of the Korn.
Cos a bag of my life
Then I got it, so far.
It's open day like me. Insanity
Go figure, once a fag
Now a player
baptised and born,
and the Children of the Korn.

[Ice Cube:]
Children of the Korn!
I'm the first born!
Fuck authority! Hit your ass in the head with my
40.
You girls see more of me, after school, you
better run to your car.
Class clown, I already know I'm a star.
Your Children of the Korn was born, from your
porn and twisted ass ways,
now you look amazed.
I'm sitting in a daze, in a purple haze.
You better check my pulse, 'cause nothin' seems
to faze.
Bitch!
Nothin' seems to faze.
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.
Nothin' seems to faze.
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.

[Jonathan:]
Look and see, I feel the parents hating me.

[Ice Cube:]
Hurt me. You hurt me.

[Jonathan:]
Why don't you step outside and feel me?

[Ice Cube:]
Feel me! Feel me! Feel me!
How you gonna tell me where to skate, who to
date,
how to fuck, how to kiss, who to love, who to
diss,
how to live. What it is, somethin' gotta give.
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids.
What? It won't be the kids.
We're talking shit, 'cause life is a bitch.
You know it is. Everybody tryin' to get rich. God
damn!
All I wanna do is live. All I wanna do is live.

[Jonathan:]
All I wanna do is live!

[Ice Cube:]
All I wanna do is live.

All... I... want... to... do...
All... I... want... to... do...
All... I... want... to... do... is live.

Insanity.
Stop fuckin' with me.
Insanity.

[Ice Cube:]
Stop... fuckin'... with... me.
BITCH!




So you've seen I've gotten this far.
Please give me some place to rage.
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away. 
Life sometimes pisses me off.
It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away. 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some patience, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life I'd like to be really set free.
Let me be me. 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some guidance, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
(Take... take) Take me away.
(Take... take) Taken away.
Take me away.
Taken... away. 
Something I get, I got to get home 
Run, run, run, run, run, run running home 
Where is my home... 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some patience, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
Night! So I play.
Give me the sign this is day.
Give me some guidance, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want?




So... so love.
Wait, but I don't realize.
Small, white legs
Broke, the pain between her thighs
I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Skin... so cold.
Could, could someone steal a life?
Save... the blame.
Wait, I got some shit to say. 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for? 
RAPE! Something...
NOW! Rips my...
HEART! And takes...
MY! Soul I...
WAIT! Too late...
NOW! I feel...
RAPED! Inside...
TAKE! My soul away.... 
Away.... 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for...

[Fred:] Say what? Say... what?




What the fuck?!

I'm so dumb, therefore I can't relate.
I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate.
Really is it me, or is it fate?
Give me peace, or at least for fuck's sake.

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

In the past I was known as a freak.
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak.
Sang my ass off, got into this band,
Never thought the band would pick on the man.

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

Reclaim my place...

Say it to my face.

So I look around at all these stupid little faces.
Something I can never slap, but I embrace.
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be,
You want to fuck around? Then come on, fuck with me.

You think you can't relate?
You'll never ever find.
You think you feel my hate?
Look at me and you will find
My fate you always raped?
I will always be the son.
You want to fuck with me?
Come on, fucking play!

You can feel it now or be stoned!
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it now or be stoned
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it now or be stoned
Yes, you feel it come, bow down!

Bow down!

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

What the fuck?! So... What the fuck?!




Fuck all that bullshit! 

You watch me play.
I look away.
Your lights turn bright.
You found the light. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

You're gonna die!
Wanna meet me, why?
I wish I had your strength
Inside your soul escapes. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

Cry, into me.
Help me... 
Something...
For all!
The kids that die listening to me. 

You are alive! 

Time, off in space. You and I stay....

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

I...




Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away.
I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay.
I feel so lost within - pressured, I'm headed for that day.
Just one thought in my head, really. Do I need this fame? 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak,
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame. 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,
something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine.
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 

I feel the rattle... 

So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine.
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 

I feel the rattle... 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,
something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

Like some god damn fucking freak!




[Tre:]
Yeah. 

I should have known it from the start what I was in for.
She break a tin full,
she copied, we exchanged some info.
Called her on the tele, conversations were simple,
ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo.
And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames,
Nimpho's in the park, just dancin' in the rain.
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim,
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins. 

[Tre:] So baby I ask you...
[Jonathan:] What do you want from me? 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Tre:]
Rest us, rest us from the pain, if I ask.
Ashamed cos a game keep playin' me wrong.
Promise not to ever sing a damn 'nother song,
Until I realize who the fuck I am. 

A man out of sync with his own program,
trying to find some kind of inner link.

You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Tre:]
Ahh yeah. 

She's the epitomy of sweet misery,
The sweeter the stroke, the deeper the pain given.
There's an angel, angle sex-driven.
Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten.
Fittin' like a glove, with abstract relations,
Testin' all my patience, push comes to shove.
Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love,
Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above. 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.




There you are my precious 
Not long ago 
Hiding behind the shadows 
Of your broken soul 
Why is it always you want something you can never have?
Why did you you try to tell me? 
How could you be this way 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

There you are my precious 
With your broken soul 
Rubbing my crotch, elated 
Taking control 
Why is it always 
You fuck up something you have always had 
Why'd you try to tell me 
How could you be so cold? 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

Here I am, just a man 
Feeling the pain, gives me life 
Relieving us is my plan 
I'd do anything to see through your eyes
Just to see through your lies 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 

Can't you feel the pain? 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain

But I don't listen to her,
'cos my head is like a sieve

My daddy, he disowned me,
'cos I wear my sisters clothes

He caught me in the bathroom,
with a pair of pantyhose

My basketball coach,

For wearing high heels sneakers,
and acting like a queen

Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree
Gonna tie his pecker to a tree

Get your boogie off

Go Head

The world is coming to an end and I don't give a dam

As long as I have my bitch
Oh I'm a fuck you

It don't bother me, if people think I'm funny
'cos I'm a big rock star, and I make lots of money
Money, money, money...

Money, ka ching

Lots of money

Don't give a fuck, break it out
You even know, Boy George is on heroin
We don't give a fuck
Rick James is in the crack house

Ha, ha, ha, ha, aahh, ha, ha, ha

The bomb is a fucking in the house
Loco! Ooooh aahhh oooo
Gimme some




All I want in life is to be happy (happy).
It seems funny to me.
How fucked things can be.
Everytime I get ahead.
I feel more dead.




Hey, I'm feeling tired.
My time, is gone today.
You flirt with suicide.
Sometimes, that's ok.
Do what others say.
I'm here, standing hollow.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.
Day, is here fading.
That's when, I would say.
I flirt with suicide.
Sometimes kill the pain.
I can always say.
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
It's lost and can't be found.
(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
Slow it down.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

Twisting me, they won't go away.
So I pray, go away.

Life's falling away from me.
It's falling away from me.
Life's falling away from me.
Fuck!

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.




How did it start?
Well, I don't know.
I just feel the craving.
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.
And it's just there for the taking.
These little girls they make me feel so god damn exhilarated.
I feel them up, I can't give it up.
The pain that I'm just erasing. 
I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?
I don't know why it hurts me.
All I wanna do is get with you.
And make the pain go away.
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me.
Why do I have this torment?
All I want to do is fuck it away. 

I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.




This shit right here is for you.
All your faces I can see.
You all think it's about me.
I'm about to break.
Is this my fate?
Am I still damned to a life
Of misery and hate.

You will never know.
What I've done for you.
What you all put me through.
I'd do it for you.
I could have never lived.
If it wasn't for you.




Everyone is looking at me.
I can't get out of bed.
There is evil in my head.
Everyone just let me be.
Because when I hit the stage.
It is gone and I am free.
Goddam you say you'll get up for me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

Tell me, how could this fade?
I am going in shame.
And I could not have my pain.
Everyone please let me be.
Because when I hit the stage
It is gone and I am free.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

I feel the shame.
I'm not insane.
The things I feel now.
Arent the same.
Who gives a fuck..
If my life sucks?
I just know one day.
I won't give up.

Everyone just let me be.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

Be there, for me.




I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation.
There's so much shit around me.
Such a lack of compassion. 
I thought it would be fun and games (would be fun and games).
Instead it's all the same (it's all the same).
I want something to do.
Need to feel the sickness in you. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

All I'll do is look for you.
I know your fix, you need it to
Just to get some sort of attention, attention.

What does it mean to you?
For me it's something I just do.
I want something.
I need to feel the sickness in you. 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

Does it make me bad?




Ooh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I've gotta let her go (What happened?).
(What happened then?).
Never let it up, let it up, let it up.
Ah! Let it up. 
I dont want this to go away (Go away).
I'm so scared (Going away).
I can't stand what's going on (It's going away).
We all crumble (It's still gonna go away).
(It's still gonna go away).
We crumble under pressure (pressure).
Pressure (pressure).
I can't go living on...




Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up! 
Each day more frightening.
All of us wanna die.
The pressure's tightening.
I don't even want to try.
Should I take all the stupid bullshit.
What makes them think they can get away with it.
I'm not happy.
I wish they just...

Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!

Wake the fuck up!

What are we fighting for?
You are my brothers.
Each one I would die for.
Please just let it go.
All the heads are blown.
Let's take the stage and remember what we play for.

No more fighting!!
I swear I'm gonna leave.
Talking shit to spite me.
I wish we just.. 

Wake the fuck up!

Am I going crazy?
Am I going insane and dazed?
Am I too lost to face this?
And what will it cost to escape? 
Nothing is right.
I am so scared.




Let me see (let me see).
How my life has been (taken).
Taken.
This demon (haunts me).
Haunts me.
They're waiting (help me).
Help me. 
You fuck me up.
I'm gagged and bound.
You pick me up when I am down.
I can not live without them.
I do not live without them. 

Hey, daddy (Daddy).
They are taking me (away).
Biting.
Facing him (my soul).
My soul.
They're eating.
Please help me. 

You fuck me up.
I'm gagged and bound.
You pick me up when I am down.
I can not live without them.

They say this thing inside of me.
Wants to get out.
All it does is scream and shout.
I'm trying not to let them out.
They tell me to hurt myself.
They tell me to hurt myself.
They tell me to hurt myself.
But I'm not going to listen. 

You fuck me up.

Hey, Daddy (waiting).




I can't stand to let you win.
I'm just watching you.
And I don't know what to do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Feeling all the hurt you hide.
Thought you were my friend.
Seems it never ends. 
I need somebody someone.
Can't somebody help me.
All I need is to be.
Loved just for me. 

Giving you this and that.
Giving gave nothing back.
It's all related to.
All the things I do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Seeing all the things you tried.
I am nothing. 

I look I sign.
I need someone.
Inside to help me out.
With what I'm trying.
I'm crying, I'm frying.
In a pile of shit.
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
I'm dying 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone. 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone. 

Someone.




Lately things won't go my way.
Lately everything is grey.
It feels like something.
It feels like.. nothing 
So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I'm angry for today.
Anger's the only thing I've made.
It feels like something.
No it's.. nothing. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

To live this way. 

Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me I can't
Wait to give them these feelings of hating.
Deep down inside me for all to take.
picking at me.
They're ripping at me.
Ripping at me. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

(Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me!)




A man is crying, takes me to a certain place.
Which I don't often find.
You see a family walking.
Always thinking of being somewhere else in time.
So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.
Please give me some of it back.
The feelings I had.

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you.
It doesn't matter.
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth.
I can't handle.

Let's get this party started.
I'm sick of being you.
You make me feel insane.
We don't give to you.
Let's get this party started.
You make me feel insane.
I want to be the one.
To make myself sane.

Time is ticking, it makes me feel content.
With what I have inside.
Constant paranoia surrounds me.
Everyone I see is out to get me.

So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.

I am going insane.
This shit is all about pain.
I cannot retain as the shit oozes out my brain.
I wish you could be me.
And then as you would see.
How tired I am.
And how she kept the best of me.
At least you could look at me.
While you are raping me.
You are taking my life.
And sellin it tee hee.
Why should I complain.
At least it helps my pain.
I am very cool now.
And it doesn't blot my fame.
I am going insane.
This shit is all about pain.
I cannot retain as the shit oozes out my brain.

You fuckin pussy!




I can't bare to face what's growing in my head.
Please get away from me.
Take advantage of what I still guess you do.
One day you'll beg for me.
So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

You just see me as something you throw around.
you weren't there for me (there for me).
Beating down to the ground, yes it always seems.
You take more from me (from me).

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

It's funny how we get started.
They get their money from the things on you.
They get your money and the girls and the fame.
I only do it for the fun.
That's my game.

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.




Keep knocking.
No one's there.
Pouring down.
Near be felt. 
I'm out here, by myself.
All alone.
Ready to blow my head off.
I hurt so bad inside.
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again.

Keep hoping.
Nothing to spare.
So my life.
Isn't quite there.
Feel like a whore.
A dirty whore.
Such a whore.
Dirty. 

I'm out here, by myself.
All alone.
Ready to blow my head off.
I hurt so bad inside.
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again.

I'll Take it
I'll Take It
I Will Take it
Into you.

You dirty little fuck.
Dirty little fuck.
You dirty little fuck.
Dirty little fuck.
You dirty little fuck (I will take it).
Dirty little fuck (I will take it).
You dirty little fuck (I will take it).
Dirty little fuck (I will take it).
You dirty little fuck. 

I'm out here, by myself.
All alone.
Ready to blow my head off.
I hurt so bad inside.
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again...




This time, taking it away
I've got a problem, with me getting in the way,
Not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror.
I won't have to see the pain (bleed, bleed)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

My mind is done with this,
Okay, I've got a question.
"Can I throw it all away?"
Take back what's mine
So I take my time, guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein (vein, vein)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

I'm here to stay (bring it down) [x4]
Bring it down [x4]
Gonna break it down [x7]
GONNA BREAK IT!

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

Give anymore [x4]




I'm thinking of, 
Thanking all the fucked people
Thanking all the shit I love,
They are all the things I've made
Straight from my heart, 
Begging all the same people
Burning is the same evil
Some how making me feel sane

Waiting all this time
I've got nothing to hold on
But the faces of my life
I can see before I'm gone

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow

I'm thinking of, 
Making all the fucked people
Making the bitches I love
Make them die and go away
Pain from the start
All my dreams are ripped apart
Thanking all the fucked people
They are all the things I've saved

Waiting all this time
I've got nothing to hold on
But the faces of my life
I can see before I'm gone

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow

Your Life (your life),
I hate (I hate) it, oh god
Can I replay (replay)?
Stop and help me. (stop and help me)

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow 

The shit seems to follow (Shit seems to follow)
The shit seems to follow [x2]




So I think you are a fool
Hanging on my every word
I'm getting ugly, So I'm ugly..

Tear me from your heart
Tearing me apart.

So I thought you'd disappear
Being alone is what you fear
Are you lonely?
Yes, lonely.

Tear me from your hearttttttlllliiifee
Tearing me apart.

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are.

The time is coming
Gone Insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you’re to blame

The time is coming
You've gone insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you’re to blame

Blame [x4]

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far

Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are. [x2]




Beating the fall
I can’t help but desire of falling down this time
Deep in this hole of my making I can't escape
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...(lives [x7])

Fearing to fall and 
Still the ground below me calls
Falling down this time
Ripping apart all 
These things I have tried to stop
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain?
Asking why?
All alone?
Where is God?
Looking down?
We don’t know?

We fall in space, 
We can't look down,
Death may come 
Peace I have found
What to say? 
Am I alive, 
Am I asleep? 
Or have I died

(Wanting Peace)
We fall in space
(Wanting Peace)
We can't look down,
Death may come,
(Something takes a hold of me)
Peace I have found 
(Something takes a hold of me)
I want to say my whole life,
Am I asleep? 
We fall down. 

We come to this place
Falling through time, 
Living a hollow life, 
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs, 
Hollow lives...

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain?
Asking why?
All alone?
Where is God?
Looking down?
We don’t know? [x2]

We fall in space
We can't look down
Death may come.
Peace I have found
