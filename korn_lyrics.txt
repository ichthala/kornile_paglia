

Are you ready?!

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self esteem is low, how deep can I go, in the ground that I lay?
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.
This time I look to see what's between the lines!

I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind... [x12]
I'm blind [x4]




There you are alone
With no hope of ever having something to be proud of
Something earned without begging
Yes, I know you're a person, a person close to me
Who do you think you are? What more do you want from me?!
Ball Tongue!
-You got the dykes off, I think they'll mind me
Ball Tongue!
-The rag I'm on, we are justified
Ball Tongue!
-Congrats you just fucked up my make-up and shit
Ball Tongue!
-What have you done for me?!

Why are you at home buried in your own self pity?
Why do you insist on living the life clean out of me?
Yes, I know you're the person, the person that took time with me
Does it give you the right to expect your life revolves around me?!
Ball Tongue!
-You have come to take from your buddy
Ball Tongue!
-You have never been so funky
Ball Tongue!
-The higgle got sick of me
Ball Tongue!
-Ahh, the dick is fine for the day
Ball Tongue!
-Your brother took it from me
Ball Tongue!
-Unidetified enemy
Ball Tongue!
-Come fucking back to save us and gave up
Ball Tongue!
-They've come to deliver me

You were my brother, Where does our friendship end? [x3]
You were my brother, I'm not going to give in

How can you fuck'n doubt me, but not again [repeated]

Ball Tongue!
-They've driven right by my friends
Ball Tongue!
-They've taken the take above me
Ball Tongue!
-You're a psycho monkey
Ball Tongue!
-They've come to enslave me
Ball Tongue!
-They've jacken themselves onto me
Ball Tongue!
-Your fuck'n gangster signs
Ball Tongue!
-They've come not to save them, but they take
Ball Tongue!
-Fuck'n death to fuck'n me

'Cause I'm a phsyco-fuck [repeated]

Ball Tongue!
-Berome's dead at the technodrome
Ball Tongue!
-You're right, he's dead, tear gas dropped, but who was it?
Ball Tongue!
-It dosen't of the rhythm of the damn monger
Ball Tongue!
-Can I die?! Can I die?!
Ball Tongue!
-And then, the man kept kick'n me
Ball Tongue!
-He gets him on, they're cool
Ball Tongue!
-He wasn't dead, and then they knocked him on the head
Ball Tongue!
-No more, he's rid of you. You're a Dyke!




I, I am confused, fighting myself
Wanting to give in, needing your help
Skin cold with fear, feel it when we touch
Outside I don't know you, but inside I'm fucked

Can you see it in me?
Skin cold from touch
Each day confronted with what I have done
You pull me closer, I push you away
You tell me it's OK, I can't help but feel the pain

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I love you!
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you
Why do I cry?
Why do I really need to?
Why! Why! Why! Why!
Fuck you, bitch!
Need to [x3]... fuck [x4]...

I hate you!
Why are you taken?
I love you!
I feel so helpless
Why is it you?
Ripping my insides each time I'm with you
Why do I try?
Why do I fucking need to?
Fuck [x6]

Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

I don't run around trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

I hide only to defy you 
Take away the only love inside you
I see the face through everyone 
Inside I've just begun! 
You think I'm out to scare you 
I'm only out to prepare you for when you stop and turn around
Your body's going down! 

You're gonna waste your time, 
Your life will soon be mine, 
You're definitely one of a kind, and 
You're suffering 'cause of me, it's divine 

Tell me why you never liked me 
Tell me why it is you fight me (Tell me why, so you'll fight me)
Pull down and wait for the perfect time to take what is rightfully
mine
You think they're dumb to defy me
You said you don't want to defy me 
-You wait, to dumb run anyone (. . .you don't want anyone)
Oh well. . . 

You know what, Fuck you! 
I'm fed up with you! 
I'm not as good as you?! 
Fuck no! I'm better than you! 

Did you really think you'd beat me at my own game?! 
You try to see what you got 
Me ripping at your brain!




HIV!

Here I am different in this normal world
Why did you tease me? Made me feel upset
Walking stereotypes feeding their heads
I am ugly. Please just go away

HIV!
I can see it's hard to find
This blessing in disguise
HIV!
Why do you treat me this way?
Made the hate stay (Made the hurt stay)

As I walk I can never seem to escape
All the laughing, all the pain
If you were me, what would you do?
Nothing, probably. You'd just throw your way...

Faget! [x2]

You wouldn't know a real man if you saw it
It keeps going on day after day, son
You faggot, if we don't want none
I'm sick and tired of people treating me this way everyday
Who gives a fuck?!
Right now I got something to say to all the people that think
I'm strange and I should be out here locked up in a cage
You don't know what the hell is up now anyway
You got this pretty-boy feeling
Like I'm enslaved to a world that never
Appreciated shit
YOU CAN SUCK MY DICK AND FUCKING LIKE IT!

Go! 

I can, in every way
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes to me 
Evil thoughts is creeping through my mind
Who are you to say that I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away 
It's so predictable 

I can, in every way, feel the stress that tangles up inside 
Too blind to see, emptiness and sorrow of their lives 
You run away to the cover of their pointless ties 
You ask me? 
It's so predictable 

I'm gonna try 
I'm gonna die 
I'm gonna try 

another day 
Silence overwhelms my mind 
who is to say 
If I have the time, oh why 
should I pray 
for all the hate to go away 
another day 
I can never break free 
You wait for me 
I call out to you 
Another day 
I'll live forever!




I can't stand the sight of you 
I can't stand what you put me through 
Your life's a lie, that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 
I can't stand, oh, the thought of you 
I can't stand all the things you do 
What do you try to justify? 
You were just too scared to be you inside 
Let!
It all go 

(I look) at you, all I see, is a man too afraid to really be

I can't stand what you put me through 
I can't stand even the thought of you 
Your secret lies that you hide 
Is it that terrible being you inside? 

You try so hard to be wanted 
-False emotions tells you fronted 
I feel being a person relies on one thing: 
Be yourself, let you come through 
you're too afraid to really be 
Someone who isn't false, who dosen't care to be 
Be yourself, let you come through! 

Fake! 
-You'll regret it, you'll regret it




I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to
Search through these problems that haunt and taunt you
I smile, while you're afraid
Your run, while you're so in pain

Do you ever see it [out from] outside your fears
Thinking about your life
Thinking about your inner fears

I would like to search inside
For all of the things that you will hide
What's the problem?
Can't you seem to open your body and let me touch you

I want you to see the life you have disguised
The world of things that hurt you
Kept all these useless lies
I want you to fear, fill you on up inside
Once I took you in, I'll throw you out next time
I tried, you win
My life is ripping your heart out and destroying my pain!
Go!




'Ello, esta Caco
Et eres Caco
Well, you know, you fucking call me the Caco, okay?

I keep asking, what's your lie?
It is disturbing
This isn't mine
Why
Days keep passing
A lot of time
I don't feel right
Please God let me sleep tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

I keep asking
Well, again, please try
It is haunting
This takes my mind
Days keep passing
Line after line
I don't feel right
Please God don't let me die tonight,
Die tonight, die tonight, die tonight

Everyday confronted circumvents giving in
I just wanna know why!

Want to give it up, but I can't escape. [x4]

Please God, please God
Please God help me
Please God save me
Please God help me from my painful situation

Please God don't let me slip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me chip in tonight, please God
Oh, please God don't let me slip in tonight, don't let me die
Please God don't let me give in tonight, don't let me die




Mother please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done, remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child, looking so pretty
Come out and play, I'll be your daddy
Innocent child, looking so sweet
A rape in my eyes and on your flesh I'll eat

You've raped!
I feel dirty
It hurt!
As a child
Tied down!
That's a good boy
And fucked!
Your own child
I scream!
No one hears me
It hurt!
I'm not a liar
My God!
Saw you watching
Mommy why?!
Your own child

It's alright

I didn't touch you there
Mama said she didn't care
I didn't touch you there
That's why mama stopped and stared

I fucking hate you! Mother fucker!
Mother Fucker! I fucking hate you! Fuck You!
You son of a bitch, you fucking ruined my life!
I wanted to die!
I'm sick of it, mother fucker.... oh oh
Why'd you fuckin' do it to me?
I Hate You!
I Fuckin' Hate You!
I Hate You!
Why?!
I Hate You!




You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right

On top you think you're bomb artista
But you're bent out of, oh, right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're, oh, right

Sometimes things might make me
Oh, it makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
Rugged in mind a hint of bite
Why does it not exist in you?

Right, shit, why hit in yet another day
Woo hoo right
It's not woo hoo right
But you're wrong

Twist, twist, twist, twist

Put me in right, now make mad
Prove that you're right
Somehow you're not right, huh
But that don't make me mad

Right now you're beggin' for a little brew
All night
Yeah, it's so simple
I had some red dog, you hand over it

Twist, twist, twist, twist




Pain!
Buried so far away
Enter my life of nothing

Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!
Sick of the same ol' thing,
so I dig a hole, bury, pain!

I am so high, always
Burying my life so slowly

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

It opens my mind to feelings
Can't face bottom without something

[chorus]

We enter in my head
Feeling like I'm God
With the world around me
Can't you feel this pain!
reaming through my heart!
screaming through my veins!
nothing I can kill!
screaming a lie! I! Am!
Can't you feel my eyes out
Can't you take my heart. . . away
To heart
Good-bye

[chorus]




Why can't I decide, why my feelings I hide?
Always screwing with my mind, that thorn in my spine
Oh sure, it feels fine, wasting all our time
In the back of my mind, a thorn in my spine

Wait! to see it before my eyes
Why! do I run away?

Looking all the time at your face so blind
Feeling uptight, always the same fight
Hey man now decide, go ahead take your time
Kissing all the time, that thorn in my spine

Wait! You can only see one side
Why?! Play yourself out 'dat way?
Why?! You and me always hang
Wait! Weren't you my friend?

The pain in which I could not feel!!!

Hey man look inside, now you need your own life
Remember me guy? That thorn in your spine
Waiting all the time, I'm doing mighty fine
Remember me guy? That thorn in your spine

[chorus]




Fuck yes! 
Always I'm locked in my head 
Know pain, you don't know what I have had 
By now, I'm so for sure 
Right now, I am yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me, oh hell no 

It came unknown to me 
Paranoid is controlling all of me 
Somehow, a terror so pure 
Right now, shit I'm yours 

My sorrow, I swallow 
Follow me all, oh hell no 
Wasn't me, I swallow 
Forgive me, i don't know 
Oh hell no. . . 

This thing I follow 
The place, I'm too scared to fuckin' go 
A freak, that I'm sure 
A freak, that is yours 

[chorus]

Freak . . Punk ass sissy I'm a freak. . .




Pleasant things I feel...




You came into my life without a single thing
I gave into your ways, but you left me with nothing
I've given into smiles, I've dealt with all your games 
I wish you're happy now, I had to let you win 

Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 
Why don't you get the fuck out of my face, now!! 

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my brain 

I scream without a sound 
How could you take away everything that I was? 
Leave me a fuckin slave 
Your face that I despise 
Your heart inside that's gray 
I came today to say, you're fucked in every way 

[Chorus]

In the sea of life, you're just a minnow 
You live your life insecure 
I feel the pain of your needles 
As they shit into my mind 
You stole my life without a sigh 
You sucked me dry 

[Chorus]




Boomerang, Zoomerang, Doomerang, Up

the time has come to realize what you are, what you've done inside
The time has come, we'll have something to talk about
I will too

Looking back. . .dumb

how much you really loved him. . .dumb
This child's mind you terrorized. . . old man
You came to him. . .dumb
He really didn't know your lies. . .old man
Now, his innocence gone. . .dumb
He's that child you terrorized. . .old man

This fucking thing that I know, it came to me from you
This fucking hate that I feel, because of you
My childhood is gone, because I loved you
My childhood is gone, because I loved you

Be my neighbor
Looking back. . .child

[chorus]

First you told me everybody was my neighbor
they took advantage of me and then they took their turns hating me
I wish I wouldn't have watched you, I really mean it
My childhood, a failure
What a fucking neighbor

I hate you, I will too

[chorus]

This fucking hate that I feel!!!
This fucking thing that I feel!!!
My childhood is gone!!!
My childhood is gone!!!

I will too...

HaHaHa! 

I see your faces and I do not understand why 
Each time I dream you standin there, right by my side
Why do you make me, you take my pride 
and in my eyes you kinda rape me, inside 

I have no place to run and hide 
I have no place to hide which I like 

Some look at the time, I looked back into my life 
You want to touch me to see what's in my eyes 
Why do you make me remember all the hate all its shame 
Don't you hate me, sometimes? 

[chorus]

I got no place to run, so don't come follow me 
I don't know where to run, so don't make fun of me

You want my vote, no your never gonna get it 
Cause I'm the one with the tight mad skills

Don't say nothing just listen 
Got me, got me a plan to break Tyson out of prison 
You going my way you get served 
Still got a deuce then I bunny hop the curb 
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin, never seen with a happy grin
Gotta fat frown cause I'm down, so take a look around
All you see is big black boots, step in, use my steel toe as a weapon
And it's awfully quiet, you want to live with this nigger, to with
From here to New York I get them skins, and I ain't talking about p

Ready to bring that noise and kinda trigger happy like Ghetto

'Cause police got equal, hey, A horse is a pig that dosen't fly straight

I'm threw with the pig, so I think the job is dead, get out. . . 

[chorus]




Honestly, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of

It doesn't bother me, 'cause I will always be that pimp I see
in all of my fantasies

So what? Let's. . .

Screwin' may be the only way that I can truly be free
from my fucked up reality
so I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause its so fun to see my
face staring back at me

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's fuck.

All Day I Dream About Sex
All Day I Dream About fuckin'

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid
What's my problem today? 
Maybe I'm depressed, 
Maybe I'm not listening to what comes out my pen
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

I hate writing shit, it is so stupid 
Why do I feel this way? 
It is in my eye 
I'm in way too far 
Can't it won't go away 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

I hate writing shit 
Ain't looking foward to it 
What's fucked up, today? 
Writing all this time 
Feeling all that's mine 
Come right out my pen 
Pain. . .Pain. . .Pain. . . 

Before long my song is dying! 

Tell me now, I want to know 
Is it me inside you see? 
Ahh, it isn't fair 
I got a little son inside me. . .free. . . 

Set me free 
It just sets me free 
It just sets me free 

Before long my song is dying! 

That;s why I died, this lie, I try!!!




Lady life, don't you cry
My life, pain is God
Many nights, painfull thoughts of her
Yell at me, again I'm wrong

In denial, I tried to be your friend
I tried to be a good boy
All I see, a hate deep inside
Startle me, someone save me

Now these memories, fill my heart, they bury me

All I wanna do!
You are not my real mother
Is kill you
Should I'd beat and stab and fuck her

Looking back I was never ever right
You were my step-mom who always wanted me out of your sight
I would come walkin' in and I 'd say hello,
but you slap me and you make some fucked up comment about my
clothes
So I tried to let it pass, but the visions in my head
were with you, with a knife up your ass, laying dead
so I pop some more caps in your ass,
Now your son is not so fun
Motherfucking bitch! Never try to play me!!!

You made my life not so good

All I wanna do! . . . is kill you

[chorus]

Wish you were dead now!!!

How can I cry over someone I never loved?
How can I cry over someone I never loved?
Never loved. . .




Come on! 
Save some for me, it's what I like. 
I wanna play, you know it's time. 
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
Come on! 
It's on! 
Now see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
Once I cave in, what can I fight? 
I can never win, my self I don't like, 
I don't like, I don't like, I don't like. 
Something is calling, I can't keep from falling. 
Come on! 
It's on! 
You see it's my fault, angels stabbing me inside.
Nothing changes, just rearranges, for me this time. 
This time. This... time. 
For me, inside. Put me inside. 
Hold me, this time. Put me inside. 
Come on! 
It's on!




Something takes a part of me.
Something lost and never seen.
Everytime I start to believe,
Something's raped and taken from me... from me. 
Life's got to always be messing with me. (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain. (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain... in vain. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release. (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free... is free
Chorus 

Boom na da mmm dum na ema 
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema 

GO! 
So...fight! something on the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight
So...something on the... dum na ema
Fight...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
No...some things they fight 
Fight...something of the... dum na ema 
Fight...some things they fight 

[Chorus]

Part of me...
Oh...




Hate, something, sometime, someway,
something kick on the front floor.
Mine? Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give.. me.. some.. thing.. that.. is.. for.. real.
I'll never ever follow.
Get your boogie on...
Hate, something, someway, each day, feeling ripped off again.
Why? This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give.. me.. noth.. ing.. just.. feel.
And now this shit will follow.
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Oh, I see
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me.
I don't feel your deathly ways.
Each day i feel so hollow, inside I was beating me,
You will never see, so come dance with me.
Dance with me
Rumbiddieboo
Rum bum dee dum dee bum diddie doo
ME!
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Got the life.
Got... the... life.




Come on, step inside, and you will realize.
Tell me what you need, tell me what to be.
What's your vision?
You'll see, what do you expect of me?
I cant live that lie. 

[Chorus:]
Hey!
I've sick mom,
With a fucked dad.
Dealing with your life.
Dead bodies everywhere. 
You!
Really want me to be a good son. Why?
You make me feel like no one. 

Let me strip the plain, let me not give in.
Free me of your life, inside my heart dies.
Your dreams never achieved, don't lay that shit on me.
Let me live my... life.

[Chorus]

You want me to be, something I can never ever be! [x2]

[Chorus]

Dead bodies everywhere! [x8]




[Ice Cube:]
Attention all parents!

Report to your local church!
Report to your local police department!

[Jonathan:]
Glaring into my sons eyes.
Reveals a void
I felt her in the day.

Droppin' smoke in the alley, makin' noise with a
double pump,
Bring your boys turn up at a party with you
doubled up.
Double ridie, double party, hardcore, teenage,

We're comin' strong.
Generation triple X, we're all about the weed
smoke and the kinky sex nigga what

Go figure, once a fag
Now a player
baptised and born,
and the Children of the Korn.

[Ice Cube:]
Children of the Korn!
I'm the first born!
Fuck authority! Hit your ass in the head with my
40.
You girls see more of me, after school, you
better run to your car.
Class clown, I already know I'm a star.
Your Children of the Korn was born, from your
porn and twisted ass ways,
now you look amazed.
I'm sitting in a daze, in a purple haze.
You better check my pulse, 'cause nothin' seems
to faze.
Bitch!
Nothin' seems to faze.
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.
Nothin' seems to faze.
Your children of the Korn, children of the Korn.

[Jonathan:]
Look and see, I feel the parents hating me.

[Ice Cube:]
Hurt me. You hurt me.

[Jonathan:]
Why don't you step outside and feel me?

Feel me! Feel me! Feel me!
How you gonna tell me where to skate, who to
date,
how to fuck, how to kiss, who to love, who to
diss,
how to live. What it is, somethin' gotta give.
Parents or the kids, it won't be the kids.

BITCH!




So you've seen I've gotten this far.
Please give me some place to rage.
I'm not trying to go there, so take me away. 
Life sometimes pisses me off.
It's never a good trip for me
Every time I reach for love, it's taken away. 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some patience, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
There's nothing wrong wanting to be loved.
Is there something wrong with me?
For once in my life I'd like to be really set free.
Let me be me. 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some guidance, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
(Take... take) Take me away.
(Take... take) Taken away.
Take me away.
Taken... away. 
Something I get, I got to get home 
Run, run, run, run, run, run running home 
Where is my home... 
Night! So I play.
Give me a sign this is day.
Give me some patience, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want? 
Night! So I play.
Give me the sign this is day.
Give me some guidance, so I pray.
It's time to die. Is that what I want?




So... so love.
Wait, but I don't realize.
Small, white legs
Broke, the pain between her thighs
I see your pretty face,
Smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Skin... so cold.
Could, could someone steal a life?
Save... the blame.
Wait, I got some shit to say. 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for? 
RAPE! Something...
NOW! Rips my...
HEART! And takes...
MY! Soul I...
WAIT! Too late...
NOW! I feel...
RAPED! Inside...
TAKE! My soul away.... 
Away.... 
I see your pretty face,
smashed against the bathroom floor!
What a disgrace!
Who do I feel sorry for? 
Smashed and raped!
Not again. This is a real crime.
What a pretty face.
Who do I feel sorry for...

[Fred:] Say what? Say... what?




What the fuck?!

I'm so dumb, therefore I can't relate.
I'm so dumb, there is nothing to hate.
Really is it me, or is it fate?
Give me peace, or at least for fuck's sake.

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

In the past I was known as a freak.
Had no friends, picked on 'cause I was weak.
Sang my ass off, got into this band,
Never thought the band would pick on the man.

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

Reclaim my place...

Say it to my face.

So I look around at all these stupid little faces.
Something I can never slap, but I embrace.
You'll never ever see, you'll never ever be,
You want to fuck around? Then come on, fuck with me.

You think you can't relate?
You'll never ever find.
You think you feel my hate?
Look at me and you will find
My fate you always raped?
I will always be the son.
You want to fuck with me?
Come on, fucking play!

You can feel it now or be stoned!
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it now or be stoned
Yes, you feel it come, right now!
You can feel it now or be stoned
Yes, you feel it come, bow down!

Bow down!

Give him something to say.
Something super fly, never play.
All I hear is disgrace.
Erase them all and reclaim my place.

What the fuck?! So... What the fuck?!




Fuck all that bullshit! 

You watch me play.
I look away.
Your lights turn bright.
You found the light. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

You're gonna die!
Wanna meet me, why?
I wish I had your strength
Inside your soul escapes. 

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

Cry, into me.
Help me... 
Something...
For all!
The kids that die listening to me. 

You are alive! 

Time, off in space. You and I stay....

Take, off in space. You and I.
Time, off in space. You and I. 

I...




Every day it gets a little harder, can't seem to get away.
I remember there's a certain place, a place I wish I'd stay.
I feel so lost within - pressured, I'm headed for that day.
Just one thought in my head, really. Do I need this fame? 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so weak,
Something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

I lay in bed at night and wonder, should I go on this way?
It's the only thing I really got for now, and it's called fame. 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,
something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine.
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 

I feel the rattle... 

So I see this face so innocent and fine... and so fine.
So I see this face and I realize it's mine. 

I feel the rattle... 

Every time, god damn, I look at my son (seed), I see something I can't be.
Beautiful and care free, that's how I used to be.
Like some god damn fucking freak, I'm so pressured, I'm so worried,
something takes a hold of me, something I can't believe.

Like some god damn fucking freak!




[Tre:]
Yeah. 

I should have known it from the start what I was in for.
She break a tin full,
she copied, we exchanged some info.
Called her on the tele, conversations were simple,
ain't playin' games, my game, retain the tempo.
And things, no shame, two sparks turned into flames,
Nimpho's in the park, just dancin' in the rain.
Hook me with this fix, and look to drain my aim,
Some never retain what wouldn't suck from your veins. 

[Tre:] So baby I ask you...
[Jonathan:] What do you want from me? 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Tre:]
Rest us, rest us from the pain, if I ask.
Ashamed cos a game keep playin' me wrong.
Promise not to ever sing a damn 'nother song,
Until I realize who the fuck I am. 

A man out of sync with his own program,
trying to find some kind of inner link.
A man out of sync with his own program,
trying to find some kind of inner link. 

[Tre:] So baby I ask you...
[Jonathan:] What do you want from me? 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Tre:]
Ahh yeah. 

She's the epitomy of sweet misery,
The sweeter the stroke, the deeper the pain given.
There's an angel, angle sex-driven.
Dangerous sex kitten, warm as a mitten.
Fittin' like a glove, with abstract relations,
Testin' all my patience, push comes to shove.
Emotional masturbation, fuckin' with my love,
Fuckin' with my life, fuckin' all the above. 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked. 

[Jonathan:]
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.
You see this time, I cannot ever never love another, cunt
You trick ass slut, love twice and you'll get fucked.




There you are my precious 
Not long ago 
Hiding behind the shadows 
Of your broken soul 
Why is it always you want something you can never have?
Why did you you try to tell me? 
How could you be this way 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

There you are my precious 
With your broken soul 
Rubbing my crotch, elated 
Taking control 
Why is it always 
You fuck up something you have always had 
Why'd you try to tell me 
How could you be so cold? 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain 

Here I am, just a man 
Feeling the pain, gives me life 
Relieving us is my plan 
I'd do anything to see through your eyes
Just to see through your lies 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 

Can't you feel the pain? 

I hate you, Can you feel the pain? 

Your throat, I take grasp 
Can you feel the pain? 
Then your eyes roll back 
Can you feel the pain? 
Love racing through my veins 
Can't you feel the pain? 
Your heart stops beating 
Can't you feel the pain 
Black orgasms 
Can't you feel the pain 
I kiss your lifeless skin 
Can't you feel the pain




[Cheech Marin:]
Dun nun nun
Dun nun nun
Dun Dun Dun

Odale! (O-da-le)

My Momma talk to me,
Try to tell me how to live

But I don't listen to her,
'cos my head is like a sieve

My daddy, he disowned me,
'cos I wear my sisters clothes

He caught me in the bathroom,
with a pair of pantyhose

My basketball coach,
he just kick me off the team

For wearing high heels sneakers,
and acting like a queen

Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree
Gonna tie my pecker to a tree to a tree
Gonna tie his pecker to a tree

Get your boogie off

Go Head

The world is coming to an end and I don't give a dam

As long as I have my bitch
Oh I'm a fuck you

It don't bother me, if people think I'm funny
'cos I'm a big rock star, and I make lots of money
Money, money, money...

Are you talking petsos?

Money, ka ching

Ha, ha, ha

Lots of money

I'm so bloody rich

Lots of money
Lots of motherfucking money
I get looks

Ha, ha, ha

I own shopping centres, parking lots,
and stocks, and all that shit

Ha, ha, ha

I own you, ha, you too, you three
For me, he he, oh oh

Get your groove off
Let's bring it back one more time Jonathan
Jonathan on them drums, getting ever slower
more grooving, slow that shit down
crazy slow, come on, death, right here, slow, ah
Don't give a fuck, break it out
You even know, Boy George is on heroin
We don't give a fuck
Rick James is in the crack house
I'm fucking paying, that's all that matters
Ha, ha, ha, ha, aahh, ha, ha, ha

The bomb is a fucking in the house
Loco! Ooooh aahhh oooo
Gimme some




All I want in life is to be happy (happy).
It seems funny to me.
How fucked things can be.
Everytime I get ahead.
I feel more dead.




Hey, I'm feeling tired.
My time, is gone today.
You flirt with suicide.
Sometimes, that's ok.
Do what others say.
I'm here, standing hollow.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.
Day, is here fading.
That's when, I would say.
I flirt with suicide.
Sometimes kill the pain.
I can always say.
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
It's lost and can't be found.
(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
Slow it down.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

Twisting me, they won't go away.
So I pray, go away.

Life's falling away from me.
It's falling away from me.
Life's falling away from me.
Fuck!

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.




How did it start?
Well, I don't know.
I just feel the craving.
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.
And it's just there for the taking.
These little girls they make me feel so god damn exhilarated.
I feel them up, I can't give it up.
The pain that I'm just erasing. 
I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?
I don't know why it hurts me.
All I wanna do is get with you.
And make the pain go away.
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me.
Why do I have this torment?
All I want to do is fuck it away. 

I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.




This shit right here is for you.
All your faces I can see.
You all think it's about me.
I'm about to break.
Is this my fate?
Am I still damned to a life
Of misery and hate.

You will never know.
What I've done for you.
What you all put me through.
I'd do it for you.
I could have never lived.
If it wasn't for you.




Everyone is looking at me.
I can't get out of bed.
There is evil in my head.
Everyone just let me be.
Because when I hit the stage.
It is gone and I am free.
Goddam you say you'll get up for me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

Tell me, how could this fade?
I am going in shame.
And I could not have my pain.
Everyone please let me be.
Because when I hit the stage
It is gone and I am free.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

I feel the shame.
I'm not insane.
The things I feel now.
Arent the same.
Who gives a fuck..
If my life sucks?
I just know one day.
I won't give up.

Everyone just let me be.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, beg for me, beg for me.

Goddam you say you'll get up with me.
You're the crowd, come on give it back to me.
You won't beg for me, be there for me, beg for me.

Be there, for me.




I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation.
There's so much shit around me.
Such a lack of compassion. 
I thought it would be fun and games (would be fun and games).
Instead it's all the same (it's all the same).
I want something to do.
Need to feel the sickness in you. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

All I'll do is look for you.
I know your fix, you need it to
Just to get some sort of attention, attention.

What does it mean to you?
For me it's something I just do.
I want something.
I need to feel the sickness in you. 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

Does it make me bad?




Ooh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I've gotta let her go (What happened?).
(What happened then?).
Never let it up, let it up, let it up.
Ah! Let it up. 
I dont want this to go away (Go away).
I'm so scared (Going away).
I can't stand what's going on (It's going away).
We all crumble (It's still gonna go away).
(It's still gonna go away).
We crumble under pressure (pressure).
Pressure (pressure).
I can't go living on...




Wake the fuck up!
Wake the fuck up!

Each day more frightening.

The pressure's tightening.
I don't even want to try.
Should I take all the stupid bullshit.
What makes them think they can get away with it.
I'm not happy.
I wish they just...

Please just let it go.
All the heads are blown.
Let's take the stage and remember what we play for.

No more fighting!!
I swear I'm gonna leave.
Talking shit to spite me.

Am I going crazy?
Am I going insane and dazed?
Am I too lost to face this?
And what will it cost to escape? 
Nothing is right.
I am so scared.




Let me see (let me see).
How my life has been (taken).
Taken.
This demon (haunts me).
Haunts me.
They're waiting (help me).
Help me. 
You fuck me up.
I'm gagged and bound.
You pick me up when I am down.
I can not live without them.
I do not live without them. 

Hey, daddy (Daddy).
They are taking me (away).
Biting.
Facing him (my soul).
My soul.

I'm trying not to let them out.
They tell me to hurt myself.

Hey, Daddy (waiting).




I can't stand to let you win.
I'm just watching you.
And I don't know what to do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Feeling all the hurt you hide.
Thought you were my friend.
Seems it never ends. 
I need somebody someone.
Can't somebody help me.
All I need is to be.
Loved just for me. 

Giving you this and that.
Giving gave nothing back.
It's all related to.
All the things I do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Seeing all the things you tried.
I am nothing. 

I look I sign.
I need someone.
Inside to help me out.
With what I'm trying.
I'm crying, I'm frying.
In a pile of shit.
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
I'm dying 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone. 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone.

Lately things won't go my way.
Lately everything is grey.
It feels like something.
It feels like.. nothing 
So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

So I'm angry for today.
Anger's the only thing I've made.
It feels like something.
No it's.. nothing. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

To live this way. 

Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me I can't
Wait to give them these feelings of hating.
Deep down inside me for all to take.
picking at me.
They're ripping at me.
Ripping at me. 

So I came too far.
To end up this way.
Feeling like I'm god.
Feeling there's no way. 

(Hating, feeling, falling to the
Place where people haunt me I can't
Help but keep from falling to the
Place where people call me!)




A man is crying, takes me to a certain place.
Which I don't often find.
You see a family walking.
Always thinking of being somewhere else in time.
So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.
Please give me some of it back.
The feelings I had.

Sometimes I wish I could be strong like you.
It doesn't matter.
Each time I wake I'm somehow feeling the truth.
I can't handle.

Let's get this party started.
I'm sick of being you.
You make me feel insane.
We don't give to you.
Let's get this party started.
You make me feel insane.
I want to be the one.
To make myself sane.

Time is ticking, it makes me feel content.
With what I have inside.
Constant paranoia surrounds me.
Everyone I see is out to get me.

So I fall face down in a rut.
I can't seem to get out of.
Please wake me.
Please give me some of it back.

I am going insane.
This shit is all about pain.
I cannot retain as the shit oozes out my brain.
I wish you could be me.
And then as you would see.
How tired I am.
And how she kept the best of me.
At least you could look at me.
While you are raping me.
You are taking my life.
And sellin it tee hee.
Why should I complain.
At least it helps my pain.
I am very cool now.
And it doesn't blot my fame.
I am going insane.

I can't bare to face what's growing in my head.
Please get away from me.
Take advantage of what I still guess you do.
One day you'll beg for me.
So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

You just see me as something you throw around.
you weren't there for me (there for me).
Beating down to the ground, yes it always seems.
You take more from me (from me).

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

It's funny how we get started.
They get their money from the things on you.
They get your money and the girls and the fame.
I only do it for the fun.
That's my game.

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.

So I'm saying nothing.
Each day taking that much more.
As I'm screaming all my pain.
You will be there counting.




Keep knocking.
No one's there.
Pouring down.
Near be felt. 
I'm out here, by myself.
All alone.
Ready to blow my head off.
I hurt so bad inside.
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again.

Keep hoping.
Nothing to spare.
So my life.
Isn't quite there.
Feel like a whore.
A dirty whore.
Such a whore.
Dirty. 

I'm out here, by myself.
All alone.
Ready to blow my head off.
I hurt so bad inside.
I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again.

I'll Take it
I'll Take It
I Will Take it
Into you.

You dirty little fuck.
Dirty little fuck.
You dirty little fuck.
Dirty little fuck.
You dirty little fuck (I will take it).

I wish you could see the world through my eyes.
Each day is the same
I just wanna laugh again...




This time, taking it away
I've got a problem, with me getting in the way,
Not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror.
I won't have to see the pain (bleed, bleed)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

My mind is done with this,
Okay, I've got a question.
"Can I throw it all away?"
Take back what's mine
So I take my time, guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein (vein, vein)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.

I'm here to stay (bring it down) [x4]
Bring it down [x4]
Gonna break it down [x7]
GONNA BREAK IT!

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

Give anymore [x4]




I'm thinking of, 
Thanking all the fucked people
Thanking all the shit I love,
They are all the things I've made
Straight from my heart, 
Begging all the same people
Burning is the same evil
Some how making me feel sane

Waiting all this time
I've got nothing to hold on
But the faces of my life
I can see before I'm gone

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow

I'm thinking of, 
Making all the fucked people
Making the bitches I love
Make them die and go away
Pain from the start
All my dreams are ripped apart
Thanking all the fucked people
They are all the things I've saved

Waiting all this time
I've got nothing to hold on
But the faces of my life
I can see before I'm gone

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow

Your Life (your life),
I hate (I hate) it, oh god
Can I replay (replay)?
Stop and help me. (stop and help me)

Sometimes I feel it chasing me
All the hate that's breaking free
I realize I'm taking everything
And the shit seems to follow

This time I feel it taking me
To a place I hate to be
All along I sing to make believe
And the shit seems to follow 

The shit seems to follow (Shit seems to follow)
The shit seems to follow [x2]




So I think you are a fool
Hanging on my every word
I'm getting ugly, So I'm ugly..

Tear me from your heart
Tearing me apart.

So I thought you'd disappear
Being alone is what you fear
Are you lonely?
Yes, lonely.

Tear me from your hearttttttlllliiifee
Tearing me apart.

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are.

The time is coming
Gone Insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you’re to blame

The time is coming
You've gone insane
Your really happy
You've won the game

The time is coming
A bed of flames
Your life is over
And you’re to blame

Blame [x4]

Rolling, and throwing, consoling
Everything that goes this far
Joking and hoping, revolting
All that shit that's who you are
Holding, and scolding, revolving
Peel it back, reveal the scar.
Loathing, exploding, controlling
This is what you really are. [x2]




Beating the fall
I can’t help but desire of falling down this time
Deep in this hole of my making I can't escape
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...(lives [x7])

Fearing to fall and 
Still the ground below me calls
Falling down this time
Ripping apart all 
These things I have tried to stop
Falling all this time

We come to this place
Falling through time 
Living a hollow life
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs
Hollow lives...

Is there ever any wonder why we look to the sky?
Search in vain?
Asking why?
All alone?
Where is God?
Looking down?
We don’t know?

We fall in space, 
We can't look down,
Death may come 
Peace I have found
What to say? 
Am I alive, 
Am I asleep? 
Or have I died

(Wanting Peace)
We fall in space
(Wanting Peace)
We can't look down,
Death may come,
(Something takes a hold of me)
Peace I have found 
(Something takes a hold of me)
I want to say my whole life,
Am I asleep? 
We fall down. 

We come to this place
Falling through time, 
Living a hollow life, 
Always we're taking
Waiting for signs, 
Hollow lives...

Death may come.
Peace I have found




It ain't fading 
Man I gotta let it out
Am I crazy?
Screaming nothing ever comes out
I keep feeling lost
I'll never find my way out
I'm not thanking them
Unless the truth can pour out

Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing am I funny?
I hate inside,
I hate inside.

I'll take this time
To let out what’s inside
Cuz I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride.
And all this hate is bottled up inside

My heart's breaking
Man you really ripped it out
You take pleasure watching as
I claw my way out
The hurt rising
Soon it's gunna to tear my soul out
It’s not kosher feeling like I’m on my way out

Give me some courage
Beating me down now for some time
Are you laughing am I funny?
I hate inside,
I hate inside.

I'll take this time
To let out what’s inside
Cuz I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride.
And all this hate is bottled up inside

[scat in background]
Feeling the haze as they cut down my spine
Pealing your flesh like the way you've cut mine
Do you feel happy, you fucked up my mind
You’re going to pay this time
[scat in background]

I'll take this time
To let out what’s inside
Cuz I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride.
And all this hate is bottled up inside

[Slower]
I'll take this time
To let out what’s inside
Cuz I will break
Sometimes I wish you'd die
Full of sorrow
You raped and stole my pride.
And all this hate is bottled up inside




Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies 
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down 
I wanna see you try to take a swing at me 
Come on, gonna put you on the ground, ground, ground 

Why are you trying to make fun of me? 
You think it's funny? 
What the fuck you think it's doing to me? 
You take your turn lashing out at me 
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me 

All of my hate cannot be found 
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming 
So you can try to tear me down 
Beat me to the ground 
I will see you screaming 

Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies 
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown 
I wanna kill and rape you the way you raped me 
And I'll pull the trigger 
And you're down, down, down 

Why are you trying to make fun of me?

My life is such a waste
Begging on something to work this time
But why can't I relate?
Feeling all I do is get what's mine
Holding on to faith, never gave me nothing but despair
So why do I create just to be swallowed?

I can't take (we have a start)
I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
Come what may (we are the stars)
I can't wait (I’ll take what’s mine)

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find

I Cannot take this place
Burning up inside this space of mine
So why can't I replace, feelings I find hard to really find?
I try but I can't taste
Memories they always fuck with me
So why do I create just to be swallowed?

I can't take (we have a start)
I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
Come what may (we are the stars)
I can't wait (I’ll take what’s mine)

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find, 
find, find, find, find, find, find, find

All my feelings have been eating onto me
Feed inside, is there something wrong with me?

I can't take (we have a start)
I can't take (we got a fantasy) 
Come what may (we are the stars)
I can't wait (I’ll take what’s mine)

Been hating all this time before I crawled inside
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find
Been hating all this time too far to cross the line
Been hating all the faces of everything that I could find, 
find, find, find, find, find, find, find




Always just coming in here,
starts the game
Why can't this puzzle be solved
each time it happens it's
always the same
I look down and then start to bawl

And all I see it burned my eyes
burning all inside

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over (taking all that’s mine)
one more time.

Always this teasing 
sometimes I lose faith
where is my strength to hold on?
facing existence how can I relate?
Do I stand clear or move on?

And all I see it burned my eyes
burning all inside

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over (taking all that’s mine)
one more time. [x2]

Falling through this space in time
buried in this hurt of mine
falling slowly like a dream
falling through a world unseen

why can I not break this spell?
I'm in darkness, is this hell?
falling towards this hole I see
this is how it has to be.

caught in the corners of my mind
beginning over one more time
taking me over (taking all that’s mine)
one more time. [x2]

One more time [x2]




Pick me up
been bleeding too long
Right here, right now
I'll stop it some how

I will make it go away
can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Shut me off
I am ready,
Heart stops
I stand alone
Can't be on my own

I will make it go away
can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Am I going to leave this place?
What is it I'm running from?
is there nothing more to come? (am I gonna leave this place?)
Is it always black in space?
Am I going to take it's place?
Am I going to leave this race? (Am I going to leave this race?)
I guess god's up in this place?
what is it that I've become?
is there something more to come? (more to come)

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man? [x2]




Blood is pouring
Sleep is boring
Don't stop running
I'm here counting

The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
Will he keep fuckin' with me? There's no where else to go!

So I walk but seem to crawl
For, I'm giving in today
Now I run into a wall
Cause I cannot fight my way

You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace)

My life, worry, life is story
Give up, beating
I'll start, needing

The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
The life, the hurt, the pain, the hate
Will he keep fuckin' with me? There's no where else to go!

So I walk but seem to crawl
For, I'm giving in today
Now I run into a wall
Cause I cannot fight my way

You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) (Embrace Embrace [x4])

Oh
Uh, uh, uh uh.
Uh, uh, uh uh.
Uh, uh, uh uh.
Uh, uh, uh uh.

What really do I have to follow?
Nothing makes sense at all.
Taking something for nothing
Watch me as I fall.

I'm bringing me down [x3]
I'm bringing me...down

You've gotta come with me (I cannot stand this place)
We're falling off the world (and I'll give in this way)
We had a chance to run (and now I can't believe)
We're going all the way (and all the affairs embrace) [x2]

Maybe I’m insane
walking on a wire
maybe I’m the same
Nothing can take me higher
tell me where to start
think I'm at the end
Right now, feeling pain
make it go away

Maybe I'm to blame
maybe I'm a Liar
maybe we're the same
nothing can stop the fire
I can't feel my heart
but I feel the shame
Nothing left to say
soon I'll fade away

These places all I ever
think about is lost in time
these faces taunting me I'm looking back
and they are mine

I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, then lead astray
Thinking back to times of yesterday
I could die

I'm trying to find a better way
but I'm trapped, can't get away
All I think is about yesterday
I could die

Maybe I’m insane
walking on a wire
maybe I’m the same
Nothing can take me higher
I can't feel my heart
but I feel the shame
Nothing left to say
soon I'll fade away

These places all I ever
think about is lost in time
these faces taunting me I'm looking back
and they are mine

I'm hiding from the things they say
Doing time, then lead astray
Thinking back to times of yesterday
I could die

I'm trying to find a better way
but I'm trapped, can't get away
All I think is about yesterday
I could fly. [x2]




You and me
We have no faces
Soon our lives they’ll be erased
Do you think they will remember?
Or will we just be replaced
Oh I wish that I could see,
How I wish that I could fly
All the things that hang above me
To a place where I can cry

So what can it be? 
No one hears me call,
Echoes back at me
No ones there.
To all these nameless feelings
I cant deal with in my life
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine
You’ve got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind
I know its time to leave these places far behind

You and me 
We have no faces
They don’t see us anymore
Without love as they had promised
And no faith for what’s in store
Oh I wish that I could see
How I wish that I could fly
All the things that hang above me
To a place where I can cry

So what can it be? 
No one hears me call,
Echoes back at me
No ones there.
To all these nameless feelings
I cant deal with in my life
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine
You’ve got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind
I know its time to leave these places far behind

Where are all these feelings hiding?
Dancing in and out my mind
Burning up all that I long for 
Feeding me till my decline
Where are you? My soul is bleeding 
I am searching am I blind?
All alone and bound forever
Trapped inside me for all time

To all these nameless feelings
I cant deal with in my life
To all these greedy people 
Trying to feed on what is mine
You’ve got to fill your hunger 
And stop fucking with my mind
I know its time to leave these places far behind [x2]




I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self control breaks down
Why's everything so tame?
I Like my life insane
I'm fabricating and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt just Fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound
So why'd I feel the need?
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
and watch the blood hit the ground

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again,
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

I fucking hate you [x4]
I fucking hate you (Shut up!) [x3]

Shut up!




I am living without you
You think everything will be fine
I find making it hard to lie
Realize nothing is left inside

I'm about to break some fucking off
Going to lose my mind
I'm about to break some fucking off
I feel I'm feeling fine
I'm about to break some fucking off
No it won't be fine
I'm about to break some fucking off

My lies is going to hurt you
my fate is not going to wait this time
I play, games just to spite you
I know, you're going to believe this time

I'm about to break some fucking off
Going to lose my mind
I'm about to break some fucking off
I feel I'm feeling fine
I'm about to break some fucking off
No it won't be fine
I'm about to break some fucking off

Feel me as I'm laughing
Leaving, eating, fucking
Hating all this bullshit
Maybe I can't stand this
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
I can't stand this

Fuck
I'm about to break some fucking off
Going to lose my mind
I'm about to break some fucking off
I feel I'm feeling fine
I'm about to break some fucking off
No it won't be fine
I'm about to break some fucking off
Off, off, off, off




Why can't you ever back down?
Why can't you just shut your face?
Oh god the feelings I feel
Would get me thrown in a cage
You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away, I can't see
Lead the way, make them pay

Counting, on me. 
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

You see the pain in my face
While you keep putting me down
Inside the rage starts to build
You push me I won't go down
You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away, I can't see
Lead the way, make them pay

Counting, on me. 
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

Could it really be the day, today?
Could this really make the problems go away?
I'm going to hurt just not in time

Right now!
- I take in all I can now
Right Now!
- You've torn us all part
Right Now!
- There is nothing you can do to stop me
Right now [x9]

Counting, on me. 
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave [x2]




Pounding, it starts again
Hurting, oh where do I begin?
Screaming, they dance around my head
Hoping, they'll maybe end up dead

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again (I gotta do this right)
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)
Here it comes again!

Silent it goes away
Patient, oh really should I stay?
Trying so hard to get ahead
Failure, is often where I'm lead

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again (I gotta do this right)
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)
Here it comes again!

Oh I must hold on
Oh I won't be gone
Oh I won't stop now
Oh I don't know how

Why I can't hold on?
Why I can't be gone?
Why I can't stop now?
Why I'm don't know how?

Here we go again (again) [x8]

Feeling it grab hold, what can I say?
Really fucked up again (I gotta do this right)
I can't fucking given in (I feel that I can fight)
Can't I ever win (I'll keep it on my mind)
Here it comes again!




I'm not doing great
I feel like I'm dead
Not thinking straight
Inside my body, troubled, full of hate
I had to let it out before it's too late

Deep Inside, It can't hide!
Feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me everytime
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape
Screaming and clawing from deep inside

Why won't it fade
Outside I had to lie; "I'm ok",
I hope someday, I'll stop getting pain
I guess this is a lie, I have made

Deep Inside, It can't hide!
Feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me everytime
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape
Screaming and clawing from deep inside

What am I doing?
I can't believe this
I have been hiding
Wanting to be less
Giving to people,
They take from me
Always they bringing drama to me

Look, look at me now
NOWWWWWWWW

Feeling so lost and betrayed
why does this happen to me everytime
Stuck in this place, where I can't escape
Screaming and clawing from deep inside

I can't stand all this fucking Pain
Please god just go away
Please god just make the pain...




Realized I can never win
Sometimes I feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me why am I to blame
Aren't we suppose to be the same
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me 
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me why am I to blame
Aren't we suppose to be the same
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed
I feel so enslaved
I really Tried
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Oh God, the anger's changing me [x2]




Away, I see it's going down
Today, Hoping in time,
Will bury all this pain
And will awake something inside

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known

Our lives, were good in everyway
Too late, time after time
Our love just turned to hate
but we stayed by each others side

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known

I keep holding on, I feel I'm where I belong
Everytime we fight, it feels so wrong
I feel so enslaved by my pride
Then we meet again

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out
then we fight

Hey, I know feels like I lost everything
That I've known, I cannot survive alone
It feels like I lost everything that I've known




[Nas:]
Everybody's an Enemy
telling me lies and it's killing me
why they all want to get rid of me
Everybody's my enemy
Several try to disguise the devil in them
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling
like my dick does when watching nikkid women
do sick stuff on my porn collection on television

[Nas:]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll
cuz everybody is an enemy [x2]

[Nas:]
Watching my own back
strapped in chrome, to my homies
where the tombstones at, where the hoes at?
Cuz to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites
with benzene, amen
Look at the trash they biting
The life in times is kinda weaker
like the time and life of the sandman
on Apollo theater
imagine that another black with a hook
who pulls the wack talent off the stage
I'm enraged

[Nas:]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll
cuz everybody is an enemy [x2]

[JD:]
You fill your lies around me
and you think you've won
You feel you can control me 
with the things you've done

[JD:]
You think that you can take me
you think that you can play me
you're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me [x5]

[Nas:]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
they all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of ya'll
cuz everybody is an enemy [x2]




I can not ever find a way
To throw these darkened thoughts away
Need a place to hide
Its thrown in my face everyday
Guess thats the price I have to pay
For whats inside my mind

A-live! [x8]

I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I died
Now I'm alive

A-live! [x8]

Little things tempt me everyday
Lots of pain is how I like to play
Better not cross that line
Voices in my head have to be saved
Its something I cant throw away
Whats inside my mind
I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I died
Now I'm alive

I bide my time
I'm intertwined
I'm falling in this place I thought I left behind
(feeling so alive)

A-live! [x4]

I am alive
I will never run away
Places inside
My heart screams inside with pride
Once I cried
Now I wipe away the tears
Once I died
Now I'm alive




Run away no where
To chicken shit, two face
I'm gonna go there
The fear I cannot taste
You think you got me (you laugh)
You're gonna tumble down (you laugh)
Keep coming for me (fuck off)
I'll drop you on the ground

I fuck with no one
Until you get into my face

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Let's do this now [x2]

You're gonna feel how (alright)
I really am with you (you're right)
You're going no where (must stop)
Don't really know what to do (you're right)
It's going to go on (fuck off)
Until you run away (alright)
You can't control me
You best do it my way (you won)

I fuck with no one
Until you get into my face

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Let's do this now [x2]

Don't you know that
You can punch me?
Don't you know that
You can bring me down?
Oh my life would be so easy now
If you hadn't stepped across that line
LINE!

Break you down
Mercy, I cannot allow
Through your face, My fist will plow
Watching as your blood pours down
Let's do this now [x5]




We are the pain
We are the shame
We've gone insane
Inside where no ones around

I am to blame, for everything
I like this game, that you all
make me play

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on and you bring me down

We are estranged
We are deranged
I can't explain
How you all break me apart

I am to blame, for everything
I like this game, that you all
make me play

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on and you bring me down

We wait, we hate
We try to get away
Mistake my pain
It has been lead astray
I'm Looking around, I drop to the ground
Why does it have to end this way

Feeling numb, so long
Oh God it's just everything
It's everything
Now I pray for all of them to go away! 

I'm done being there for others
They have their pain and so do I
Don't need to feel it all over
I try to hold on and you bring me down

Fuck that, Fuck that [x4]

What's going on today?

Spinning inside rotting away
Something inside of me has been taken away
Feeling my heart breaking in vain
It won't get better now
When will this end?

I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play
With my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?

Hopeless inside alone as I wait
Brewing inside of me is your endless hate
Feeling my heart breaking in vain
It won't get better now
When will this end?

I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play
With my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?

The stress is rising and I can't seem to get away from you
You're always trying and the lying always shines right through
My God I hate this
Always take shit
Can I let this go on?
Why can't I break this
I just take this
As this goes on and on

End
When will this end? [x7]

I can't seem to get away
I feel I'm here so you can play
With my head
There's nothing I can say
I keep feeling like I'm to blame
When will this end?




I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me

Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live

Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God, help me
Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please, God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell

Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell




Yo, pretty ladies around the world
Gotta a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls
Tell your brother, your sister and your momma too
Were about to go down
And you know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don’t care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, Do your dance
Do your dance quick, mom

[Chorus:]
C’mon baby tell me what’s the word
Now, word up
(ahh ahh)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It’s the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you’ll be heard

Now all you sucker DJs
Who think you’re fly
There’s got to be a reason
And we know the reason why
You try to put on those airs
And act real cool
But you got to realize
That you’re acting like fools
If there’s music, we can use it
Be free to dance
We don’t have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance
No romance for me, mom

[Chorus:]
C’mon baby tell me what’s the word
Now, word up
(ahh ahh)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It’s the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you’ll be heard
(woo!)

[Bridge:]
Word up
(ahh ahh)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It’s the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you’ll be heard

Word up
(ahh ahh)
Everybody say
When you hear the call you got to get it under way
Word up
(ahh ahh)
It’s the code word
No matter where you say it
You know that you’ll be heard




[Part 1]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did ya leave for me?
Daddy, whatcha leave behind for me?
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

[Part 2]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey, Teachers, leave those kids alone

All in all its just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey, Teachers, leave those kids alone

All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
[Guitar]

[Part 3]
I don't need no arms around me
I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall

[Goodbye Cruel World]
Goodbye, cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Goodbye, all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye

I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not blown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self control breaks down
Why's everything so tame?
I Like my life insane
I'm fabricating and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt just Fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound
So why'd I feel the need?
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
and watch the blood hit the ground

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again,
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up or I'll Fuck you up!

Right now
Can't find a way
To get across the hate
When I see you

Right now
I feel it scratch inside
I want to slash and beat you

Right now
I rip apart the things inside
That excite you

Right now
I can't control myself
I fucking hate you

I fucking hate you [x4]
I fucking hate you (Shut up!) [x3]

Shut up!




Realized I can never win
Sometimes I feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin
My mind is laughing at me
Tell me why am I to blame
Aren't we suppose to be the same
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I've got something after me 
That's why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me
Tell me why am I to blame
Aren't we suppose to be the same
That's why I will never tame
This thing that's burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed
I feel so enslaved
I really Tried
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time
I did my time

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn't last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Oh God, the anger's changing me [x2]




Pick me up
been bleeding too long
Right here, right now
I'll stop it some how

I will make it go away
can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Shut me off
I am ready,
Heart stops
I stand alone
Can't be on my own

I will make it go away
can't be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone
these feelings will be gone
these feelings will be gone

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Am I going to leave this place?
What is it I'm running from?
is there nothing more to come? (am I gonna leave this place?)
Is it always black in space?
Am I going to take it's place?
Am I going to leave this race? (Am I going to leave this race?)
I guess god's up in this place?
what is it that I've become?
is there something more to come? (more to come)

Now I see the times they change
leaving doesn't seems so strange
I am hoping I can find
where to leave my hurt behind
All this shit I seem to take
all alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man? [x2]




This time, taking it away
I've got a problem, with me getting in the way,
Not by design
So I take my face and bash it into a mirror.
I won't have to see the pain (bleed, bleed)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

My mind is done with this,
Okay, I've got a question.
"Can I throw it all away?"
Take back what's mine
So I take my time, guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein (vein, vein)

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

I'm here to stay (bring it down) [x4]
Bring it down [x4]
Gonna break it down [x7]
GONNA BREAK IT!

This state is elevating, as the hurt turns into hating.
Anticipating, all the fucked up feelings again.

The hurt inside is fading
This shit's gone way too far.
All this time I've been waiting
No I can not grieve anymore.
For once inside awaking.
I'm done, I'm not a whore.
You've taken everything and, oh, I cannot give anymore.

Give anymore [x4]




How did it start?
Well, I don't know.
I just feel the craving.
I see the flesh and it smells fresh.
And it's just there for the taking.
These little girls they make me feel so god damn exhilarated.
I feel them up, I can't give it up.
The pain that I'm just erasing. 
I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I don't know why I'm so fucking cold?
I don't know why it hurts me.
All I wanna do is get with you.
And make the pain go away.
Why do I have a conscience?
All it does is fuck with me.
Why do I have this torment?
All I want to do is fuck it away. 

I tell my lies and I despise.
Every second I'm with you.
So I run away and you still stay.
So what the fuck is with you. 

Your feelings I can't help but rape them.
I'm sorry I don't feel the same.
My heart inside is constantly hating.
I'm sorry I just throw you away. 

I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.
I just throw you away.




I can't stand to let you win.
I'm just watching you.
And I don't know what to do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Feeling all the hurt you hide.
Thought you were my friend.
Seems it never ends. 
I need somebody someone.
Can't somebody help me.
All I need is to be.
Loved just for me. 

Giving you this and that.
Giving gave nothing back.
It's all related to.
All the things I do.
Feeling like a fool inside.
Seeing all the things you tried.
I am nothing. 

I look I sign.
I need someone.
Inside to help me out.
With what I'm trying.
I'm crying, I'm frying.
In a pile of shit.
I'm dying.
I'm dying.
I'm dying 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone. 

I need somebody (someone).
Somebody (somebody).
Someone. 

Someone.




I am watching the rise and fall of my salvation.
There's so much shit around me.
Such a lack of compassion. 
I thought it would be fun and games (would be fun and games).
Instead it's all the same (it's all the same).
I want something to do.
Need to feel the sickness in you. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad.

All I'll do is look for you.
I know your fix, you need it to
Just to get some sort of attention, attention.

What does it mean to you?
For me it's something I just do.
I want something.
I need to feel the sickness in you. 
I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

I feel the reason as it's leaving me, no, not again.
It's quite decieving as I'm feeling the flesh make me bad. 

Does it make me bad?




Hey, I'm feeling tired.
My time, is gone today.
You flirt with suicide.
Sometimes, that's ok.
Do what others say.
I'm here, standing hollow.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.
Day, is here fading.
That's when, I would say.
I flirt with suicide.
Sometimes kill the pain.
I can always say.
'It's gonna be better tomorrow'.
Falling away from me.
Falling away from me.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
It's lost and can't be found.
(falling away from me).
It's spinning round and round.
(falling away from me).
Slow it down.

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.

Twisting me, they won't go away.
So I pray, go away.

Life's falling away from me.
It's falling away from me.
Life's falling away from me.
Fuck!

Beating me down.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.
Screaming some sound.
Beating me, beating me.
Down, down.
Into the ground.




Hate, something, sometime, someway,
something kick on the front floor.
Mine? Something, inside.
I'll never ever follow.
So give.. me.. some.. thing.. that.. is.. for.. real.
I'll never ever follow.
Get your boogie on...
Hate, something, someway, each day, feeling ripped off again.
Why? This shit inside.
Now everyone will follow.
So give.. me.. noth.. ing.. just.. feel.
And now this shit will follow.
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Oh, I see
Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me.
I don't feel your deathly ways.
Each day i feel so hollow, inside I was beating me,
You will never see, so come dance with me.
Dance with me
Rumbiddieboo
Rum bum dee dum dee bum diddie doo
ME!
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I see...
God thinks we will never see the light, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say...
Got the life.
Got... the... life.




Something takes a part of me.
Something lost and never seen.
Everytime I start to believe,
Something's raped and taken from me... from me. 
Life's got to always be messing with me. (You wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain. (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain... in vain. 
Sometimes I cannot take this place.
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste.
Sometimes I cannot feel my face.
You'll never see me fall from grace
Something takes a part of me.
You and I were meant to be.
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me. 
Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release. (So do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free... is free
Chorus 

Boom na da mmm dum na ema 
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema

You're not the right one dumb damn rapper
Not the right goddamn
Who are you to rap shit take off
And who says you're right

On top you think you're bomb artista
But you're bent out of, oh, right
Suck my dick
But don't you think that you're, oh, right

Sometimes things might make me
Oh, it makes me mad
And when it happens fuck it
Rugged in mind a hint of bite
Why does it not exist in you?

Right, shit, why hit in yet another day
Woo hoo right
It's not woo hoo right
But you're wrong

Twist, twist, twist, twist

Put me in right, now make mad
Prove that you're right
Somehow you're not right, huh
But that don't make me mad

Right now you're beggin' for a little brew
All night
Yeah, it's so simple
I had some red dog, you hand over it

Twist, twist, twist, twist




Honestly, somehow it always seems that I'm dreaming of
something I can never be
It doesn't bother me, 'cause I will always be that pimp I see
in all of my fantasies

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's. . .

Screwin' may be the only way that I can truly be free
from my fucked up reality
so I dream and stroke it harder, 'cause its so fun to see my
face staring back at me

I don't know your fucking name.
So what? Let's fuck.

All Day I Dream About Sex
All Day I Dream About fuckin'

[chorus]

Anger inside builds within my body
Why you hit me? What have I done?
You tried to hit me!

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

I don't run around trying to be what's not within me
Look into my eyes, I am free
You're just a wannabe

Scream at me again if you like
Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

Hit me clown because I'm not from your town, now hit me clown

Throw your hate at me with all your might
Hit me cause I'm strange, hit me
Tell me I'm a pussy and you're harder than me

What's with you boy? Think hard
A tattooed body to hide who you are
Scared to be honest
Be yourself, a cowardly man!

Just a fucking little
J-Just a fucking little

I'm just a fucking little

Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Ring around the rosies

Ashes, ashes, we all fall down

Into my childhood they're spoonfed
Hidden violence revealed, darkness that seems real

Are you ready?!

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That can never find a way to reach my inner
Self esteem is low, how deep can I go, in the ground that I lay?
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.
This time I look to see what's between the lines!

I can't see, I can't see, I'm going blind... [x12]
I'm blind [x4]

Feeling like a freak on a leash. (You wanna see the light)

Hey you, hey you, Devil's little sister
Listening to your Twisted Transistor
Hold it between your legs
Turn it up, turn it up
Low end is coming through
Can't get enough

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do [x6]

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on
Your breast, your dress
Vibrations coming through
You're in a mess

A lonely life, where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do
Music do [x6]

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor
Music do, Music do [x4]

Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who? Says who?
Anesthetize this bitch
Anesthetize this bitch, anesthetize!
Just let me be
Between you and me don't fit

Because the music do
And then it's reaching
Inside you forever preaching
Fuck you too
Your scream's a whisper
Hang on you
Twisted Transistor




Everyone's corrupt
You should just shut up
Lay down, back off
The demon you disrupted

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Everybody's race
Lying to your face
Kick's you in the gut
Slayed you here all messed up

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Tiny splinters are in your soul (and they remain there)
Darkest life in the deepest hole (you sit and pray there)
All the deals from the things you've done (you wouldn't ever work for)
What you thought was so much fun (you have to pay for)

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

You want to sleep with him to get to who you need to know
Think that's the way to go don't you?
It's in religion, sex, and everything we do and say
I look the other way won't you?

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics

Don't want to talk about politics
Don't preach or talk about politics
Don't make me talk about politics
Don't give a shit about politics!




Your messiah was never mine [x10]

Hypocrites!
Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Drops of blood drip off your petals
Representing all our tears
in a ring of burning metal

How you wanna be, what you gonna say
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Sorcerers and Satan's come
To define the what and why
People travel across this earth
Over water, land, and sky

How you wanna be, what you gonna say
it doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on they're dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine

Weeping rose of Jeremiah
Purity unlike no other
Offers help to those who need it
Don't forget care to the brother

How you wanna be, what you gonna say it
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay
Little old lady at home
Writing out a check to send
It's all the money that she owns
She believes the world might end

How you wanna be, what you gonna say it
Doesn't bother me, who ya gonna pay

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on they're dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
I'm gonna do it blind
Hypocrites
Your messiah was never mine

Hypocrites!

Pay the ferryman, pay the fucking driver
Pay the preachers and pay the fucking liars
Pay the bitches they're touching on their dates, stand by
I'm not gonna pay it's already mine

Hypocrites!
I'm gonna do it blind!
Hypocrites!
I'm gonna do it blind!
Hypocrites! [x4]




I never knew what I was gonna be
Somebody saw what I couldn't see
And lifted me up now
I never thought I could be worthy of
Loving under the sky above
Don't let the wonderful
Why does everybody have to fit in
You should feel comfortable in the skin
Does that mean I am the

[Pre-chorus:]
Souvenir of sadness
Method to the madness
Hands up if you feel this
Anyone who has this...

[Chorus:]
Stand up! Nobody's dyin' to save you
Speak up! Nobody's waiting to see you
Wake up! Nobody's working to pay you
Let me make it clear you have this
Back then, nobody knew in the school yard
Now then! You have grown up to be this hard
Go then! Walk on this world with your heart scarred
You're the souvenir of sadness

They never knew what I was gonna say
Punch me and kick me and run away
You know who you are so
Now look at me what do you have to say
Never give up for you anyway
You know who you are so
Now look at me what do you have to say
Never give up for you anyway
Happy childhood back-lash

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Chorus]




Precious finger she knows how to hold the poison
Lick it dip it and for no particular reason
She crawls on the floor slides against the door
Press your fingers over blossom and it's season

Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Every night every day

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change

Treasure deep between the places that you hold dear
Can't it hurt to act as if we are in love here?
Lie across this chair fingers everywhere
To define all the angels up above here

Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Doesn't care if it's a 10 or a 2-way
Doesn't matter she'll be doin it her way
Every night every day

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change

When you cum (be a good girl)
Hold your breath (make it last long)
It's a mess (and it's gone)
The little death girl

Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change
Never meant to show up here anyway
Only fuckin you till the seasons change




Flesh wound, flesh wound
With medication it will fade
Should I assume
That someone hears me when I pray?

Love, full of hate
Don't you love how I break?

[Chorus]
Don't let them throw me away
Keep me and I'll be okay
Skipping a beat but it plays
Don't let them throw me away
Don't let them throw me away

Screwed up, used up
Crumpled, lying on the floor
Fucked up, shut up
All you did back then was score

I'm feeling weak
Missing parts, incomplete

[Chorus]

Hold me up into the light
Fix the cracks and fix them right
Keep the pieces in the drawer
Keep them there forever more
May come in use for some day
Recycle this shit in some way
And all that I have to say
Don't let them throw me away

[Chorus]




Mother!
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker!
They left me broken, bleeding
Son of!
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch!
Who tried to show me death's door

Everything's eliminated
Everything is dedicated
My belief destroyed my hated?
Never get what's over-rated

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

As in!
Obituaries rain down
Its ok!
We're lying naked face down

Wasn't it decapitated?
Can you see me fascinated?
Your the only thing I've damaged
What you get to be mis-managed

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
Dying here..

Don't bring me daffodils
Bring a Boquet of Pills
See some geranium
Cracked to the crainum
Protect me when you can
Respect me when I am
Dying

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill
Or flowers to steal
Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here




What were you thinking
I guess I'll never know
See your eyes blinking
Pupils begin to grow

Drilling you softly
Pulling you in
Making your mind up
What's sick or a sin

[Chorus]
Open up now
Let it all go
I'm quite certain
Say it ain't so
You're corrupted by
Some sick fuck
Oh no
Open up now
Head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that
Keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

What you've been taking
It makes you talk
Real slow
How come I'm thinking
You'd be the last
To know

(You'd be the last to know)

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

[Chorus]

Choking you gently
Gaining control
Hand you the shovel
To dig your own hole

Open up now
Let it all go
Open up now
Let it all go

Open up now
Head in the sky
Pierce the tongue that
Keeps telling lies
Feelings in my mouth
You breathe in but can't breathe out

You breathe in but can't breathe out




Keep holding on
When my brain's tickin' like a bomb
Guess the black thoughts have come Again to get me
Sweet bitter words
Unlike nothing I have heard
Sing along mocking bird
You don't affect me

That's right
Deliverance of my heart
Please strike
Be deliberate

[Chorus]
Wait
I'm coming undone
Irate
I'm coming undone
Too late
I'm coming undone
One looks so strong
So delicate
Wait
I'm starting to suffocate
And soon I anticipate
I'm coming undone
One looks so strong
So delicate

Choke choke again
I thought my demons were my friends
Getting me in the end
They're out to get me
Since I was young
I've tasted sorrow on my tongue
And this sweet sugar gun
Does not protect me

That's right
Trigger between my eyes
Please strike
Make it quick now

[Chorus]

I'm trying to hold it together
Head is lighter than a feather
Looks like I'm not getting better
Not getting better

[Chorus]




Look it buried yourself (go with it)
Is it turning you on? (go with it)
I'll be sitting right here (go with it)
When the time is right (I'll stick it)

Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty
Except the ways it's used for shitting?
When you finally come so pretty

Bitch we have got a problem
There's not enough to be hittin it

Getting off
I'm getting off
Keep getting off
Keep getting off
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you
It's not enough
It's not enough
And more can never be enough
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you

Dip your hands right in (go with it)
Come on it's not a sin (go with it)
You can let me in (go with it)
Wonder where I've been (I'll stick it)

Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty
Except the ways it's used for shitting?
When you finally come so pretty

Bitch we have got a problem
There's not enough to be hittin it

Getting off
I'm getting off
Keep getting off
Keep getting off
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you
It's not enough
It's not enough
And more can never be enough
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you

Hold my knees
Lick my treat?

Fuck I'm coming
Fuck I'm coming on you
I'm coming
Fuck
I'm coming on you

Licking your own skin, so trippy
Squeezing your own ass, so pretty
Except the ways it's used for shitting?
When you finally come so pretty

Bitch we have got a problem
There's not enough to be hittin it

Getting off
I'm getting off
Keep getting off
Keep getting off
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you
It's not enough
It's not enough
And more can never be enough
I'm getting off
I'm getting off to you




My brother, you love her
But don't give up your instincts
Hang onto you know what
They'll be gone fast as you blink
They're trained to seduce you
Suck you dry quick as they can
They tried to reduce you
Now you're barely a man

Oh my God
How can you deny the flood
That's flowing through you

Hey you
You're saying that she's all that you desire
Liar
Hey you
You think you can throw water on this fire
Liar

It's not wrong to let go
And let the woman ride you
For fuck sake, don't lose touch
With the dog that's inside you
She wanted what you had
You bet she smelt the spore
Don't give up, fuck her up
One more time, slam that door

Oh my God
How can you deny the flood
That's flowing through you

Hey you
You're saying that she's all that you desire
Liar
Hey you
You think you can throw water on this fire
Liar

Oh my God
How can you deny the flood
That's flowing through you

Hey you
You're saying that she's all that you desire
Liar
Hey you
You think you can throw water on this fire
Liar

Oh my God
How can you deny the flood
That's flowing through you




I'm getting out
I'm leaving here
I'm kickin' right through this door
I stole your girl
Who was my girl
I always said she's a whore

Must you accelerate
From everything I hate
Now this is my kind of disaster

Break in and take what we want
And then run down the liquor store
Pick up our friends
Tell them it's on
Get in
Don't ask what it's for

Sub-Woofer kickin' in
Porn on the TV screen
These spinnin' rims don't go no faster

[Chorus]
We can drive all night
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one
Just follow the light
And we're not gonna stop for the pigs or no one

We're flippin' off the people
Who dissed on our statures today
We're throwin' bricks right through their windows
And then we drive away

And break this thing around
New things are gooda found
We keep on changin' our direction

Go past the school, the church, the places that caused us hurt
We're gone
If we keep movin' foreward
Maybe we'll forget where we're from

We're gonna shake things up
We're gonna break it down
We built this car with our rejection

[Chorus]

You can never go back not even
If you wanted to know where
You're indeed now
You've been fuckin' them real good lately
One minute you come from zero
Go now

[Chorus X2]




I'm an animal
I'm a victim
I'm the answer to your prayers
I'm a witness
On the witchhunt
I'm the monster up the stairs
I'm ghost that's
In the mirror
I'm everything that you fear
I'm the riptide
I'm the soul-shock
I'm the voice that's in your head

[Chorus]
I've seen it all
Still can't taste it
Smashed to the wall
That brought me to my knees
I've done it all
Fucked up
Wasted
Still in my blood
But now inside unseen

I'm the hunted
I'm a predator
I'm the answer to the riddle
I'm the upbeat
I'm the headfuck
I'm the way yarn flips to the middle
I'm the player
I'm naive
I'm the one who's not addicted
I'm the logic
To the fuck up
I'm the broken one who fixed it

[Chorus X2]

I'm just a child
With the tears in it's eyes
I am holding this gift
That is broken
What do I have left now

I've seen it all
I've done it all
I've seen it all
I've done it all

[Chorus X2]

Now inside unseen




Well I wish there was someone 
Well I wish there was someone
To love me

When I used to be someone
And I knew there was someone
That loved me

As I sit here frozen alone
Even ghosts get tired and go home
As they crawl back under the stones

And I wish there was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish there was something more than this
Saturated loneliness

And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can
it's just saturated loneliness

Does the silence get lonely?
Does the silence get lonely?
Who knows?
I've been hearing it tell me
I've been hearing it tell me
Go home

Cause the freaks are playing tonight
They packed up and turned out the lights

And I wish there was something
Please tell me there's something better
And I wish there was something more than this
Saturated loneliness

And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
Abduct it, corrupt it, but I never can
It's just saturated loneliness

And the bath waters cold
And this life's getting old

And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
Abduct it, corrupt it 
And I wish I could feel it
And I wish I could steal it
And I wish I could feel it
Abduct it, corrupt it
But I never can
I never can
Never Can
Never Can
Never Can




I shred your bullshit poetry
Yes, it's me again
I wreck your postivity
Yes, it's me again
I fuck it to watch it bleed
I kick it to make it scream
I am the alternate choice
To some stray life I'm not saying

[Chorus]
You see beauty, I see pain
You see sky, and I see acid rain
It's me again

I rip your throat out on a whim
Yes, it's me again
I only ask for everything
Yes, it's me again
I squeeze it to feel it breathe
I smash it to fuel this need
I am the antidote for
Whatever sickness you feed

[Chorus]

Little miss fucker don't move an inch
Y'all punk suckers cant take the heat
Your blood rushing from head to feet
This is what I stand for
All unjustice thats done to man
All you fuckers know who I am
I'm living proof that you can
Turn around and say it's me again
Fuck!

[Chorus]




I'll die smiling,
Something the past
Someone said to me will,
Make me laugh,
And I'll lay back and fade away,

Let me go I'll be fine,
Frozen here in time,
Sick of being alive,

Eaten up inside

Let me die,
Go away,
I never got what I wanted,
I never got what I needed,
What's on my mind,
Who can say?
It's my invention I'm beating,
I can not stop all this bleeding,

I'll be ready,
Give me the morphine and I'll go to sleep,
As I dream maybe I will just slide away,

Let me go I'll be fine,
Frozen here in time,
Sick of being alive,

Eaten up inside,

Let me die,

Go away,
I never got what I wanted,
I never got what I needed,
Whats on my mind?
Who can say?
It's my infection I'm feeding,
I can not stop all this bleeding




Put your hand against your skin
Rub it gently to begin
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
When does pleasure become pain?
When does sex become insane?
You say yes
As you feel it

When you cum
(Be a good girl)
Hold your breathe
(Make it last long)
It's a mess
(it is called)
the little death, girl

[Chorus]
So please
When you die could you scream?
Mercy
Mercy for you and me
Its true
What they say fuck it boy
Love might be the last legal drug
So please
When you cry let it flow
I might
Make you stay, let you go
It's true
What they say fuck it boy
Love might be the last legal drug

Push that one more time that's all
And the rain begins to fall
You feel it?
Can you feel it?
People who ain't seen shit been
Telling you that its a sin
You say it
As you feel it

When you cum
(Be a good girl)
Hold your breathe
(Make it last long)
It's a mess
(it is called)
the little death, girl

[Chorus]

Le petite mort

[Chorus]




Got to face your fear
lying on the floor
Step into nothing, what the hell am I here for?
So come on and play
Stab me in my heart
So long this time was wasted ripping me apart

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out

(God is gonna take me out)

Crawling on the floor
All around this space
Talking to myself
What is this thing I've got to face?
Walking through a door
Has it been a waste?
Going on and on thinking I could find my place

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out

God is gonna take me out (God is gonna take me out)
God is gonna take me out

You can't see
I'm torn away from you and everything that's
close to me
I cannot face the truth, it's nothing that
I believe
Just run away from me and thank me when you're
free from me
Come take me

Come take me
Come take me
Come take me
Come take me

Come take me (We are the hurt inside your head)
(Lost in the void of what is dead)
Come take me (Constantly twisting things I said)
(Happiness is boring, need pain instead)
Come take me (We are the hurt inside your head)
(Lost in the void of what is dead)
Come take me (Constantly twisting things I said)
(Happiness is boring, need pain instead)




For every person I've tried to be
There's another ten inside
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH I'M NEVER THERE
I'M ALWAYS WITH YOU BUT NEVER HERE

And you move in a hostile way
Like you're recently wounded
I REACH FOR YOUR WRISTS TO FEEL A PULSE
YOU'RE FEELING YOURSELF FOR BOTH OF US

We got a problem, it's plain to see
We got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

All the searching we do inside
Is a futile attempt to
TO SIFT WHAT WE'RE MEANT TO NEVER KNOW
IT'S ALL SCREWED UP HOW THE RIVER FLOWS

And I know that you tried to hide
To center yourself, but
WAS I THE BEAST THAT SUCKED INTO YOU?
A REAL DARK BITCH DOWN INSIDE OF YOU?

We got a problem, it's plain to see
Bitch, we got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

NICE TO FUCKING MEET YOU
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you

And this is me, and me, and me, and me,
and me, and me, and me, and me, and me

Bitch, we got a problem

Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We're both schizophrenic I fear
See how many voices you hear
Which one, which one of you is into me?
Which one, which one of me is into you?
We are schizophrenic, don't stop
No, not till I fuck this all up

Bitch, we got a problem!
Yeah!
We got a problem!
Bitch, we got a problem!
We got a problem, problem, problem
We got a problem, yes, yes
We got a problem
We got a problem
We got a problem, problem, problem




I'm diggin' with my fingertips
I'm ripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searchin' for fragile bones
(Evolution)
I'm never gonna be refined
Keep tryin' but I won't assimilate
Sure, we have come far in time
(Watch the bow break)

And I'm sorry I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me

It's evolution...
Just evolution...

And I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Hold tight, I'm getting inside you
(Evolution)
And when we're gonna find these bones
They're gonna wanna keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by
(Procreation)

And the planet may go astray
In a million years they'll say,
those motherfuckers were all deranged

It's evolution...
Just evolution...

And I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Take a look around
Nothing much has changed
Take a look around
Nothing much has changed

Take a look around
Take a look around
Take a look around
(Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around
Take a look around
(Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around
Take a look around
(Nothing much has changed)
Take a look around

I
I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here, it's controlling my mind
And why
Do I deserve to die?
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside

Why
Why do I deserve to die?




With aversion, this insertion
came so swiftly
Cut the cord, from this day forward
We'll be drifting

No direction, no affection
Watch the soul dive
You're dissected, resurrected
Still don't know why
This illness is like a monster that is
eating us alive

Hold on, be strong
So right, so wrong
With all of our senses
All of our defenses
Hold on, be strong

New arrival, our survival
still not certain
What's a virtue, where do you go to
when you're hurting?

It's a weakness, it's a sickness
in the gene pool
Show no mercy, people here say
"Kill the damned fool"
This illness is like a monster that is
eating us alive

Hold on, be strong
So right, so wrong
With all of our senses
All of our defenses
Hold on, be strong

My
Soul
Blood
Run

Don't ever let me go, no
Don't ever let me go, no
Never never let you go, no
I'll never let you go, no

Hold on, be strong
So right, so wrong
With all of our senses
All of our defenses
Hold on, be strong




Some deny and search for things that never come around
Do I feel like a fool?
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared
And I owe this all to you

I'm feeling like I'm sinking
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

The last thing I would like to do before I go away
is cry there next to you (next to you)
Cry and talk about the good old days and where they've gone
And now how much I hate you

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

I feel the blood drip off my body as it falls right there
on the ground
What am I now?

What am I now?
What am I now?

What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head unto
Something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away

Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away
Why you always push me away




Walk away when you're angry
Brace yourself, there's nothing to gain
Old enough to know the outcome
More blood, it's always the same

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For god we've suffered for so long

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on

(wait) Bite your lip, don't be cursing
(we must) We musn't take God's name in vain
(in vain) Blunt your knife, pull the curtain
(impulse) Impulses you must refrain

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on
Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For god we've suffered for so long

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on

Somebody carry on with this burden
I can't remember anything
I can't be certain

Aren't we cool and aren't we calm
For facing death we run head-on

Do what they say
Or they take it away
I'd rather be dead then carry on




You're the infection my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew it, I knew it

You're basic, but hard to define
Simple yet somehow sublime
Knew you would strike again
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Polished, you shimmer when shined
But rotten and seething inside
Everyone falls for this
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, want to be god
All to be, made to be, holding the son
Throwing it, breaking it, over your grave
Sending you back to the place you once came

It must be hard to be you
Nothing's alright with you

You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be/never be/wannabe [Repeat]
You will never be [Repeat]
You want to be God [Repeat]
It's all God [Repeat]
It's all gone [Repeat]




I read your little book and... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
I read your little book and... ha ha ha ha

You need a reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing (ha ha ha ha ha)
And everything you do
Makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

(I heard what you've said, nothing new)

You need a way to get along
A way to carry on
A symptom for the pain you're making
And surely you should know
That everywhere you go
There's acid in the words your faking

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

You write it, so you'd best believe it
You sold it, now your soul perceives it
You read a book, but now agree with it
The damage of betrayal
To Hell with your

A reason to believe
A reason to deceive
A reason for the song you're singing
And everything you do
Makes perfect sense to you
So why is your alarm bell ringing

You say you know how it feels inside of me
Lost and alone with no love or luxury
Come on inside
And hear the silence constantly judging me
Don't you think you should move on?

Don't you think you should move on?
Don't you think you should move on?




I know it's not like me to (you)
Hold back but this time I knew (rape)
You must be silent to increase the volume

In your head
Blood run red

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

You ripped your own self in two (let's)
Swear I had nothing to do (switch)
With what's been done
You know you can't but you can

In your head
Blood run red

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

Standing at the edge here
Enough for me to hover by the bit here
Enough you see I kiss you with my head - fear
So wrong that they will never reap our deaths clear

Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!

Enough's enough!
Enough's enough!

I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm a spectator, the motivator
Shut up, shut up and do it to yourself
I'm just an innocent bystander!

I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!
I'm just an innocent bystander!




Birds are circling above
They're called back to a waiting glove
Oh, why don't they
fly away?
Surely they have guessed by now
There is no gun to shoot them down
And still they stay
for what they say

Are we killing them with lies?
Are they fighting for their lives?
Killing them with thoughts?
Can we never get enough?
Killing them are we killing killing every single feeling?
It's a trained response

Birds are circling above
They're called back to a waiting glove
This sordid game
It fears my name
I have worshiped some false gods
I run to them like Pavlov's dogs
To hide my shame
and fan the flame

Are we killing them with lies?
Are they fighting for their lives?
Killing them with thoughts?
Can we never get enough?
Killing them are we killing killing every single feeling?
It's a trained response

We're all preset to reset to
DUMB
TO DUMB

WE'RE ALL PRESET TO RESET TO DUMB
WE'RE ALL PRESET TO RESET TO DUMB

Somebody told me once
Beat them 'til they start to get used to it
Next thing they're lining up

ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING IT?
ARE WE KILLING?




This sunny Sunday
Is a good day to go
Guess you want me to stay
Well then let me know
And I hate to say
It's been a waste of time
I hate to interrupt the flow

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

You say you'd love to
But you've lots left to do
Almost decided to stay 'cause of you
And I hate to tell you to exchange your dreams
For a one-way ticket, no return

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Why, why
What you hanging up for?
What you doing that for?
What you breaking up for?
Why, hushabye

I hate to interrupt the flow
For a one way ticket, no return

This sunny Sunday is a good day to go

Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Hushabye, why aren't you ready to go?
Why, Why, Why
Hushabye
Couldn't we fast forward all through this show?

Hushabye
Why, why, why I
What you breaking up for?
Why
Hushabye

We've wasted it, our time is up




What you gonna do, what you gonna feel when suddenly I slip away?
Almost am a ghost of who I used to be yesterday
How you gonna touch and how will you collect
the beauty when it turns to dust?
Every deal we make, the cells we generate are both of us

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to understand this life

Hold you in my arms and hold you in my gaze
Singing with my dying breath
Underneath this earth I resurrect your soul and nothing less
Sorry for the space, if I could fill the void an ocean wouldn't hold the love
And everything I have and all I ever was is not enough

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to understand this life

(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)

Please be aware that I am you
Nothing could be more certain
This ain't the time, the place for us to understand this life

This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!
This ain't the time, this ain't the place!

(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)
(I will protect you)




In the deepest part of me
Like an unknown enemy
I was never meant to fight
Little seed of purity
And you don't belong to me
Still I'm blinded by its light
DON'T TRY TO MAKE IT RIGHT!

Does anybody know bout love
Does anybody care bout God
If you're with me sing sorrow

Penny for your thoughts I fear
we need a little help round here
If you're with me sing sorrow

When the stars don't ever heal
Do you fear you'll never feel?
What it is to be at peace
YOU'RE CRAVING A RELEASE!

Does anybody know bout love
Does anybody care bout God
If you're with me sing sorrow

Penny for your thoughts I fear
we need a little help round here
If you're with me sing sorrow

I don't understand here
Why God would do me this way.
I lived a life
Was always good
The one thing I need to take away

TO TAKE WAY
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
just take away
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
one thing to take away
THE ONE THING (TAKE AWAY)
one thing to take away
AWAY AWAY

It took away my world
all it left was pain
and all this time was for nothing

Does anybody know about love
Does anybody care about God
If you're with me sing sorrow

Penny for your thoughts I fear
we need a little help round here
If you're with me sing sorrow




I'm facing the light
But fading to black
I'm offering peace
As I'm stabbed in the back

Yet I'm feeling able
My house is made of steel
With paper for doors

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

I'm holding the torch
But melting my fists
I'm first in the line
Yet last on the list

Yet I'm feeling able
My house is made of steel
With paper for doors

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

Or obituary!

I tried not to choke you (NO!)
But now you're dead (NO!)
I'm most uncertain (NO!)
Should I feel regret? (NO!)

I've tried to hate you
But feel regret
I'm most uncertain
I've lost the bet
I'm waiting to watch it
I'm waiting to see
Is this my overture? Or obituary?

I tried not to choke you!

Is this my overture? Or obituary?




Look at you
Feeling all good
You can't resist
You have to be all
Up in it
Don't it feel great
Talking Shit
I let it go.

[Chorus:]
Why don't you just leave me alone.
My heart's gonna break from the fall.
Holding on to petty things.
Feeling all the hate it brings.
Why don't you just leave me alone.

What a puss
Think you're so tough
I take this shit
All I had was
Love in me
It was so good
But that wasn't enough
You ripped it away

[Chorus]

All the disrespect
All the hypocrite
All the bullshit you took from me
You're such a piece of shit
Nothing but heretic
Sucking the life out of me
Fucker, you're gone without me
NOW!!!

[Chorus]

Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
Leave me the fuck alone!




Well look at this
I see clearly now
Look at this
I can feel it now
Happiness
Is seldom found
Pop the pill
I’m so damn happy now

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can’t live without you today

Well look at this
I see colors now
Look at this
I’m butt ugly now
Happiness
Is seldom found
Pop the pill
I’m so damn happy now

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can’t live without you today
You today, you today

I don't give out anything around me
Even all the love that surrounds me
Make me, Even me
I don't give out anything
I do this to shut off the voice
Within, within, within!
I don't give out anything

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can’t live without you today
You today, you today, you today

Feeling things crawl on me
I need my fix today
This is way beyond me
I can’t live without you today




I feel you all around me
Your voice, it surrounds me
You keep telling me what I want to hear

You're beautiful, so talented, I need you, we got a thing
You ever need something I'll be right there

Fear is a place to live
Rip off the mask from your head
Show me the real face that you hide

I see you from a mile away
Keep staring, acting like you gotta say

You're beautiful, so talented, I need you, we got a thing
You ever need something I'll be right here

Fear is a place to live
Rip off the mask from your head
Show me the real face that you hide

Fake ass people surround me
They're always nice to begin
Digging their claws

Fake ass people surround me
Digging their claws right in me
They're always nice to begin but
I always get fucked in the end

Fake ass people surround me
Digging their claws right in me
They're always nice to begin but
I always get fucked in the end
I always get fucked in the end
I always get fucked in the end
I always get fucked in the end
I always get fucked in the end

Fear is a place to live
Rip off the mask from your head
Show me the real face that you hide

FAKE ASS, FAKE ASS

Fear is a place to live
Rip off the mask from your head
Show me the real face that you hide




Feeling out of place
Something must be wrong
Emotions in my space
Tight grip holding on

I cant control the events around me
I can't console the stress inside me
And once I turn off my brain
I realize I am alive

I want you to see
I'm trying to please
Everyone around me
I'm down on my knees
The stress makes me bleed
It feels like they're all stabbing me

Feeling out of place
Why must I hold on
Anger I can taste
?Time itself? is gone

I can't control the events around me
I can't console the stress around me
And once I turn off my brain
I realize I am alive

I want you to see
I'm trying to please
Everyone around me
I'm down on my knees
The stress makes me bleed
It feels like they're all stabbing me

What the fuck do you want from me
I am just a human being
Living my life to please everyone
I can't do this anymore
Being everybody's whore
Being everybody's whore
Being everybody's whore
Being everybody's whore
Being everybody's whore

For once, I'm gonna stand up and ??

I want you to see
I'm trying to please
Everyone around me
I'm down on my knees
The stress makes me bleed
It feels like they're all stabbing me

... being everybody's whore... [x3]




Lost and alone
I'm out of the stone
Repeat this process everyday
Nothings my own
The dreams that I've grown
I won't control and throw away

I need to make the decisions
I need to make it right
I need to lead the parade
Or this shit will fucking take my life

I want to kill the decisions
I want to make it right
I want to pass this test
And complete my tormented life

This curse is my own
It follows me home
Its like a child that wants to play
The thoughts in my brain
The subconscious pain
Makes me think why do I stay

I need to make the decision
I need make it right
I need to lead the parade
Or this shit will take my life

I want to kill the decisions
I want to make it right
I want to pass this test
And complete my tormented life

I want to kill the decisions
I want it to be right
I want to pass this test
And complete this tormented life

Happy, everything was wonderful
So happy, it's beautiful

I need to make the decision
I need to make it right
I want to kill the decisions
I want to make it right
I want to pass this test
And complete my tormented life
I want to kill the decisions
I want to make it right
I want to pass this test
And complete my tormented life

I'm happy, I knew you'd make it right
Everything is wonderful




All the lying and cheating will surely bite you
Dishonesty tears you apart and will eat you
All the anger and pain and the suffering and the shame
And the voices in your brain will surely haunt you

Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens I can't break through

All the anger, the pain and the suffering, and the shame
And the voices in your brain will really haunt you

Let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go, let the guilt go

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens I can't break through

Now we waste our lives away
Letting guilt lead the way

I'm such a stupid fuck
Listening to my head and not my gut
Constantly thinking and thinking and thinking
And thinking and thinking and thinking

Now we waste our lives away
Letting guilt lead the way

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens I can't break through

I tell you one thing which leads to another thing
Then I backtrack which leads to hurt feelings
Then my brain spins off of fucking everything
When this happens I can't break through




You chose to take
From the past
You want a game
That's built to last 

Cause love without affection
Is hate without the pain
Life is a connection
Seperate from the brain 

You chose to take
From the past

Can't you see the pain in my eyes?
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?
I can't live with all your lies again
I can't trust anything even you my friend

You wanna lay
In the past
You'll do anything
To make your pain last

Cause love without affection
Is hate without the pain
Life is a connection
Seperate from the brain 

You just take
From the past

Can't you see the pain in my eyes?
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?
I can't live with all your lies again
I can't trust anything even you my friend

Run away, go away [x30]

Can't you see the pain in my eyes?
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?
I can't live with all your lies again
I can't trust anything with you my friend

Can't you see the pain in my eyes?
Can't you see the betrayal in disguise?
I can't live with all your lies again
Is this the end?




Hate is all around
If you see what I see
Definitely something's going on
These fingers
Pointed at me

The lying
The cheating
The hellish nights alone
While I am weeping
Just searching
Love is never around
All the waiting
Betraying
The one thing I hold sacred in my life is
Left hanging
And I'm never around

Let go
And I will truly be free
Just let go
Her mind really is the disease
So just go
Enjoy everything I received
So let go
And I will kill this unease

Let's turn this around
I'll look down on me
Now I see what's going on
Warned about you all and not me

The prying 
The cheating
The hellish nights alone
While I am weeping
Just Searching
Love is never around
All the waiting
Betraying
The one thing I hold sacred in my life is
Left hanging
And I'm never around

Let go
And I will truly be free
Just let go
My mind is really the disease
So just go
Enjoy everything I received
So let go
And I will kill this unease

[Laughter]

Hate is all around
If you see what I see
Definitely something's going on
These fingers
Pointed at me
Pointed at me
These fingers
Pointed at me

Let go
And I will truly be free
Just let go
Her mind is really the disease
So just go
Enjoy everything I received
So let go
And I will kill this unease




I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking
I know where everything in this world surrounds me

I feel your breathing
I feel your screaming
I feel I can't go nowhere in this world without leaving

My mind plays tricks on me
I can't control it you see
I feel it beating down the fake around me

My mind plays tricks on me
It's unbelievable to see
I'm always testing the shit around me

Let me tell ya something
This shit is beaming
It won't leave me alone
My disease, I'm missing
You think you feel me
You think you know me
'Cause I'm the hell in your head

My mind plays tricks on me
I can't control it you see
I feel it beating down the fake around me

My mind plays tricks on me
It's unbelievable to see
I'm always testing the shit around me

Are you ready to live?
Are you ready to die?
All I do is give
Am I wasting my time?
I am ready to live
I am ready to die
All I do is give
Am I wasting my time? (No)
Yes I'm ready to live (No)
Yes I'm ready to die (No)
All I do is give (Ahh)
Am I wasting my time? (No I'm not!) [4x]

My mind plays tricks on me
I can't control it you see
I feel it beating down the fake around me

My mind plays tricks on me
It's unbelievable to see
I'm always testing the shit around me

Are you ready to live?
Are you ready to die?
All I do is give
Am I wasting my time?
Are you ready to live?
Are you ready to die?
All I do is give
Am I wasting my time? 
All I do is give [3x]




Do you really want to see?
I don't think I can take this anymore
You are naive and I am nothing
I'm disgusting and so much more

Holding all the lies I told you
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you
Dying is a trial I've been to
This is the time for truth and pain

Do you really want to see the
Torment hatred of this world
Hand in a book and I believed it
All it brought me was pain and more

Holding all the lies I told you
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you
Dying is a trial I've been to
This is the time for truth and pain

Holding all the lies I told you
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you
Dying is a trial I've been to
This is the time for truth and pain

I believe, I believe

Holding all these lies I told you
Holding all the lies I told you
Holding all these lies I told you
Holding all these lies I told you
Lies I told you...

Holding all the lies I told you
Feeling like somehow I spoiled you
Dying is a trial I've been to
This is the time for truth and pain

Truth is pain
Truth is pain
Truth is pain
Truth is pain
Truth is pain

I believe
I never meant to hurt you
I believe
I never meant to betray you
I believe
I never meant to hurt you
I believe
I never meant to hurt you




I'm drowning and sedated
Patiently Awaiting 
For my mind to really come down
I'm afraid of being hated
Cuz I'm so Jaded
Not like everybody somehow

Trapped underneath the stairs
Dealing with the fears
Constantly it's silent and loud

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing you can do

I'm constantly debating
Why I'm always playing
Walking around with my head down
I don't want to be like anyone
What the fuck could I have done?
To deserve this terror somehow

Trapped underneath the stairs
Dealing with the fears
Constantly it's silent and loud

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing I can do

I'm not like 'em
Can't hide what I am
Like it or not
I push it down
it comes back again
The Medicine stopped working long ago
I am my problem
Inside has nowhere to go [X5]
Nowhere to fuckin' go!

I am who I am
There's nothing I can do
I try to hide it
and it keeps breaking through
I feel the world so different 
than any one of you
Remember who you are
There's nothing I can do

You're always stuck with you [X2]




My wheels keep spinning backwards
They're spinning round and round and round
My heart can't sometimes take it
Bleeding til it's broken down

Why can't someone fuckin' tell me
What the fuck's going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside

I wake up I can't breathe
I grip my sheets real tight
What the fuck is happening to me?
Damn right, I can't live this life

Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside

You wanna take me away
wanna take me away
to die
Life wants to take me away
It's gonna put me away
Tonight

Oh my god can't take this shit
Feeling like a lunatic
Holding your problems 
inside my hand
Holding motherfuckin' shit
feeling like a lunatic
A place for your bullshit to hide [X5]

Can someone please tell me
What the fuck is going on?
Why don't we love each other?
Constantly beating others down

Now, I find it hard
to live, my own life
Pleasing everyone
While I'm, just dead inside
Just dead inside [X3]
I'm just dead inside




Coming onto you
The hell you got me through
What would I have to do to kiss that frown
I know whats wrong with you
That fucked up part of you
Is gonna bury me under ground

Now I'm awake
Been stuck in a place I really hate
And it's not fate
Everything's just fine

So why must it be
Chaos Lives in Everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me

Get away from you
Is what I gotta do
I want my soul back, I'll stand my ground
So walk away from me
You know this has to be
Another way for me to kiss that frown

And it's not fate
Everything's just fine

So why must it be
Chaos Lives in Everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me
Now I'm guilty, not ashamed
Got this thing attached to me, throw it all away
It just comes back to me

Gonna take you
Gonna break you
Gonna rape you, fuck you bitch, frown
Sometimes I worry
Sometimes I'm sorry
Sometimes I just want to beat you down
Gonna take you
Gonna break you
Gonna rape you, fuck you bitch, frown
Sometimes I worry
Sometimes I'm sorry
Sometimes I just want to kiss that frown

I'm insane but now you gotta give it up to me
Life is wearing thin
My only pleasure is watching you give in
I tried
To pretend
All it got me was nothing in the end
I tried
To win
All it got me was nothing in the end

So why must it be
Chaos Lives in Everything
Trapped inside a dream
It all comes back to me
Now I'm guilty, not ashamed
Got this thing attached to me, throw it all away
It just comes back to me
It just comes back to me
It just comes back to me




Disgraced
Expendable, we are not really real
A mirage of solitude is what they try to heal and
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade

Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins and
I will Kill Mercy Within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores

Disengaged
Relinquish the reality, I've known
I'm feeling like I'm alienated from my own and
I will not be made to feel we are sealed in a fake charade

Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins and
I will Kill Mercy Within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores

Spewing vile atrocities
Bringing existence to its knees
I will manifest my sins and
I will Kill Mercy Within
Immersed in this hypnotic spell
Influenced by the hate that swells
I'm not terrified anymore
There's nothing left but open sores

Nothing left but open sores




And along came something sacred
I never knew what I found
The demons dance around, elated
They're hurting me

I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown

Falling awake in a nightmare
Images of horror abound
Thought I stumbled upon salvation
Hell I found

I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown

Well, I'll never be the same
It's the greatest lie ever told
No, I'll never be the same
I sold my soul

I put my wall up each day
You tear it down
I hide in my space
The space you found
And one of these days
I'll come unbound
The feelings I hate
Will finally drown




Don't wanna be sly and defile you
Desecrate my mind and rely on you
I just wanna break this crown
But it's hard when I'm so run down

And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal!
Got to bring myself back from the dead!

Sometimes, I hate, the life, I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking its sweet time

Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

Don't wanna be rude but I have to
Nothing's good about the hell you put me through
I just need to look around
See that life that has come unbound

And you're so cynical, Narcissistic Cannibal
Got to bring myself back from the dead

Sometimes, I hate, the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking its sweet time

Sometimes, I hate, the life I made
Everything's wrong every time
Pushing on I can't escape
Everything that comes my way
Is haunting me taking its sweet time

Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days

Holding on I'm lost in a haze
Fighting life to the end of my days




I can't believe what's happening
Where is your self control
Why can't you just be honest
The corruption takes its toll

You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You built this house of shame
You smile, you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now

I can't believe this happened
The fear starts to grab hold
Then anger starts to take over
I will not be controlled

You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You built this house of shame
You smile, you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now

They're taking over now
Eating up our souls somehow
Taking over now
Parasites, they run around
The culprits won't be found
They lie behind this mask of wealth
They're taking over now
Illuminati they hide

You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You built this house of shame
You smile, you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now

You rape our hope
Too proud to cope
You built this house of shame
You smile, you gloat
This disease you promote
An infection is what we are now




Are you scared?

Holding on to sacred places
Holding on to what is found
I'm looking forward to see their faces
Flat on the ground, the horror profound
None of you people mean shit to me
Sadistic little fucking fantasy
Smashed on the ground in your own debris
While choking on your blood from the sodomy
None of you people mean shit to me
Sadistic little fucking fantasy
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free

Walk the path of secrecy
Used to heartless mockery
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes
Your misery

All the damage it just erases
Mediocrity all around
The grandiose disorder replaces
Conditions of peace, is this my release?
None of you people mean shit to me
Sadistic little fucking fantasy
Smashed on the ground in your own debris
While choking on your blood from the sodomy
None of you people mean shit to me
Sadistic little fucking fantasy
Burn the Obedient, set yourself free

Walk the path of secrecy
Used to heartless mockery
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes
Your misery

(La La La...)

Burn the Obedient
Burn the Obedient
Burn the Obedient
Burn the Obedient
Burn the Obedient
Burn the Obedient
Now

Walk the path of secrecy
Used to heartless mockery
A hopeless fantasy that nothing changes
Your misery




A slap in the face, it is endowed
The light of my life is put out somehow
I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control
You're feeding my sympathy the lie unfolds

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

The lines that I traced
Around the scars they swell
Implant with a sedative
To numb this spell

I'm lying in pieces of emotions you control
You're feeding this cancer
it's taken hold

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

Feeling animosity
When no one else is around
Blindly, I scream into the air
Eating my heart off the ground

Feeling this hostility, I pray
Begging, make this evil go away
Coveting the things I only fear
Building my sanctuary of blood and tears

GROOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUND!




Let's Go!

What's the problem
Why can't you relax?
Inside hating on everything, that makes me mad
Love is scary and love is to blame
Guess I'll lose you and that is a shame
because I'm ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you
Ovah you

Let's Go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

The solution I try to reveal
But the question is how can you really be healed?
Hate is scary and hate is to blame
God, I need you and that is a shame
Because I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you
I need you

Let's Go!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away

Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away
Gotta get away
Can't, can't get away

LETS GO!

I'm taking over
I won't be lead astray
Life's doesn't last long
I gotta get away




I, I am clearly broken and no one knows what to do
Pieces of the puzzle don't fit, so, I pound them into you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

I can't wait to rip my eyes out and look at you
Peace through pain is precious especially when it's done by you
Itching is the pulse inside
Creeping out to come alive
It's just doing what it's gonna do

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line
And I'm, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories of what I've left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!

Times are looking grim these days
Holding on to everything
It's hard to draw the line
And I'm, I'm hiding in this empty space
Tortured by my memories of what I've left behind

Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!
Shut the fuck up! Get up!




Here it comes
Once again
'Irrational'
I give in
Paranoia
Expands within
Little voices start to begin:

Everyone's out to take your joy away
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking
You must make it stop
Make them pay

Sometimes I just take things
Way Too Far
Irrational feeling
I just try too hard 'cause
What goes up, must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause
Sometimes I just take things Way Too Far

Reality is surreal
Wretchedness is all I feel
Now its really just a way
God, I hear the voices say:

Everyone's out to take your joy away
Constantly scheming to keep us at bay
Everyone's plotting and they are just taking
You must make it stop
Make them pay

Sometimes I just take things
Way Too Far
Irrational feeling
I just try too hard 'cause
What goes up, must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause
Sometimes I just take things Way Too Far

Wooohoooo! Wooooohooooo! Wooohoooo! Wooooohooooo!

Sometimes I just take things
Way Too Far
Irrational feeling
I just try too hard 'cause
What goes up, must come down
The problem is I have no bounds 'cause
Sometimes I just take things Way Too Far




I'm staring at a face
I don't recognize
Rotten and replaced
Lifeless and benign
You can never say
That I didn't try
I can not erase
What's in my mind

I'm the one to give to you
I'm the one to break you thru
Anything you ever do will
Eat you up and impale you

I'm Bleeding Out
Been crucified by trusting you
Hate turns to shame
By praising you, adoring fool
I'm the one that set you free
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause
I'm Bleeding Out
You're never there when I need you

My thoughts they interlace
Been spun out for sometime
I wander in this maze
An act that is sublime
You can never say
That I didn't try
I cannot erase
What's in my mind

I'm the one to give to you
I'm the one to break you thru
Anything you ever do will
Eat you up and impale you

I'm Bleeding Out
Been crucified by trusting you
Hate turns to shame
By praising you, adoring fool
I'm the one that set you free
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause
I'm Bleeding Out
You're never there when I need you

I'm Bleeding Out
Been crucified by trusting you
Hate turns to shame
By praising you, adoring fool
I'm the one that set you free
Bound to burn for eternity 'cause
I'm Bleeding Out
You're never there when I need you




Oh my God! I'm feeling crazy man
What could it be?
As I walk into this place everyone's staring at me
Somehow I feel I've got a fucked up disease
As I part the seas
Fingers come out pointing at me
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha
Or funny queer?
Bitch, get outta here
Let me make myself clear
I don't give a fuck
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!

What's with the hostility?
Why is it so provoked?
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior
I feel your just plain absurd
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy

Oh my god! This shit is crazy man
Look at this scene as I watch these
Stupid people act like they are machines
They should really all drop their knees
Oh, the jealousy that's the one thing I guarantee
Do I make you laugh?
Do you think I'm funny? Ha ha
Or funny queer shit? Get out of here
Let me make myself clear
I don't give a fuck
All you people can suck my motherfuckin' dick!

What's with the hostility?
Why is it so provoked?
You're living in a fantasy that's how you cope
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior
I feel your just plain absurd
Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy

What's with the hostility?

Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy
Feel that you're superior

Ridiculous vanity that is blurred
Go ahead, kick the shit out of me
It just fuels the comedy




I'm plowing through a crowd of worthless hatred
That's falling down, at least they start to fry
Why can't I be removed, take their places?
Sometimes it's better to eat their scars

These are the times of the waking liar
Hold him close or you will expire
Holding on to the place you're thinking
Total deceit

I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?

I'm terrified by emotionless faces
They're all around me I want to die
I'm fucking trippin' out seeing faces
Of murderers covered in lye

These are the times of the waking liar
Hold him close or you will expire
Holding on to the place you're thinking
Total deceit

I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?

I love the things that make you upset
The more you hurt, the stronger I get
I love the things that make you upset
The more you hurt, the stronger I get!

I like to lose hope
Recede and cope
Like a beautiful rape
These things, aren't they great?
Aren't they great?




How come, what’s wrong with you?
Darling faces often with frowns
Let’s do what devils do
Hang each other when no one’s around
Why can’t I torture you?
Giving, then you take it away
The little things you do
Simply, I love your evil ways
Your ways, your ways, your ways

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

This fire has followed you
Nothing’s left, you’re dead on the ground
How can I covet you?
Give you hell and you can’t rebound
My soul infected you
Blackened thoughts
They run through your head
The little things you do
Simply, I wish you were dead
Were dead, were dead, were dead

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) Somehow you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me

Good bye, so long
Wish I could stay
But everything is all wrong
Good bye, so long
Wish I could stay
But everything is all wrong

Everything is all WRONG!
Everything WRONG!
WRONG!
Everything WRONG!

Prey for me, I think I owe you an apology
Somehow you bring the violence out in me
I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me
(Prey for me) I think I owe you an apology
(Prey for me) Somehow you bring the violence out in me
(Prey for me) I’m just a shell of what I used to be
Passion is sometimes a fucked up thing for me




[Verse 1]
Feelings you see.
Are so hard to believe.
All the chaos I have in my heart.
Devils I make and the love can relate.
All the solace inside tears me up.

Take me away!
Set me on fire!
There's no other way!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

[Verse 2]
We've been deceived.
It's so easy for me.
'Cause the loathing I've had from the start.
Evil disease all the hatred it breathes.
As I'm down on my knees torn apart.

Take me away!
Set me on fire!
There's no other way!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

Where do I run!?
Where do I hide!?
Give me a reason to end my life! 

Where do I run!?
Where do I hide!?
Give me a reason to get out alive!

[Chorus]
Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what are we doing now?
Feeling complacent, I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.

Give me a reason 'cause I got nothing to gain.
So what am I doing now?
(What am I doing now?)
Feeling complacent I cannot be contained.
I'm so lost and lonely now.




Sometimes things get in the way
My thoughts I cannot convey
It’s all pointing straight at you
We hate loving everyday
Our lives, twirled in every way
I give it all back to you

I can’t help this going down

I can’t take this
All my life is reckless
All our lives are dangerous
But we fake our way through
That’s what we do, We do

Sometimes things won’t go away
In turn, you just run away
It’s all coming back for you
Betrayed, life is in decay
Your thoughts you cannot obey
Right now, whatcha gonna do

I can’t help this going down

I can’t take this
All my life is reckless
All our lives are dangerous
But we fake our way through
That’s what we do
We do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger
He’s all alone and no one gets his anger
I feel this pain everytime I’m here with you, with you
All the heartache and the fucked up insults
I find you begging on your knees, I figured
This is how it’s supposed to be with you, with you

I can’t wait for your lies to be broken down
I gave you hell

I can't take this
All my life is reckless
All our lives are dangerous
But we fake our way through
That’s what we do

I can’t take this
All my life is reckless
All our lives are dangerous
But we fake our way through
That’s what we do




We are the ones taking all the pain
Falling on our faces
They don’t care anyway
Anyway, now
You’re the one that makes me feel like I’m alive
You’re the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now

We are hard and grey
Always fate, to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away
Seeking out the path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous
Don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel
Got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

We are the ones reaching out in vain
Trying to solve our problems
They won’t go away, go away now
You’re the one that makes me feel like I’m alive
You’re the one that pushes me all the time
All the time, now

We are hard and grey
Always fate to do what they say
Calling me deranged
Feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away
Seeking out my path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous
Don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel
Got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Never gonna run away
Seeking out my path
But the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous
Don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel
Got me strained, so betrayed
Get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time
Pounding all these spikes in my veins




Wake up
It’s almost over
Something is taking me
Everytime I'm up it kills me
With day to day
Shockwaves shatter me

I don't beg in security
Get up and
Don’t look back now
Don’t look back now

We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA

Giving up
I won’t stop fightning
Bring it on, it wont phase me
Everytime it makes me stronger
With day to day
Shockwaves shatter me

I don't beg in security
Get up and Don’t look back now
Don’t look back now

We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA

Go on day to day
Stirring up the happy sorrow
Why does life got be this way?
Everytime I’m up it kills me
Somewhere deep, responding change
Manipulation rapid all around
Dark all these days
Calling on something to follow

Mass hysteria (Mass hysteria)
We ride a dying star
Across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now
The fire is burning in me
MASS HYSTERIA, MASS HYSTERIA




Help me, I am breaking
And my heart is barely beating,
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking
And my lungs are barely breathing
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused

Help me, I am shaking
And my guts are really aching
And the demons they’re laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading
And my will is dissapating
As the angels put me into the ground

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused

My mind is debating, these lesions are making
This mess is sedating, the power embracing
The bullshit I’m facing, my feelings of hating
Reality is failing, this shit is degrading

And everybody’s peeking
No ones makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving
Paranoid and aroused




I'll never love again...

I won't ever have to pretend...

I'm never gonna love again...

[Verse 1:]
I don't ever wanna have to try.
Though I lie, It never flies.
I don't ever wanna have to die.
But deep inside, The death it hides.
And I never wanna clarify and justify so I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify so I pacify all the hate inside.

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.

[Verse 2:]
I don't ever wanna satisfy, 
'Cause things inside are doing fine.
I don't ever want to multiply,
'Cause deep inside I'm not qualified.
And I never wanna clarify and justify so I run and hide.
And I never wanna signify so I pacify all the hate inside.

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.

I'll never love again...

I'm never gonna love again...

Never, never...

[Chorus:]
(No)
I'll never love again.
(No)
I won't ever have to pretend.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.
(No)
Never, never, never.
(No)
Never, never, never.
(No)
I'm never gonna love again.
Never gonna have to try to pretend.
Never, never, never.




I’m walking on a razor blade
Careful not to cross the line
Every little step I take
It’s punishment time
Now I’m getting to the end of the blade
Slipping to the other side
Every little step I take
It’s punishment time

Fighting to survive
There’s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There’s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind

I’m hanging like a bat today
Crucified by design
Every little move I make
It’s punishment time
Now I’m sleeping on a bed of nails
They’re breaking through one at a time
Cause every little move I make
The punishment’s mine

Fighting to survive
There’s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There’s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind

I give and don’t get
I try to my death
For something inside me
That makes me forget [x4]

Fighting to survive
There’s no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There’s no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There’s no today
Fight or flight
I’m losing my mind




Seething, I walk the circle
I called out long ago
But somehow I get lost each time
Feeding this hunger deep inside
That never lives
The voice within eats me up inside

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let’s get together and
Play the sinner’s game
Four is for the torture and
Five is for the shame
Cause every time you want it
I get off on this game

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn’t a game
Your life, I’ll swallow
And I can’t help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won

Gloating, I plant the seed
Inside your head
Right away, watch it grow
Destroying your insides
Pleading to comfort you
With my sadistic ways
I watch the tears fall
I crack a smile

One, I love hurting you
Two, I love your pain
Three, let’s get together and
Play the sinner’s game
Four is for the torture and
Five is for the shame
Cause every time you want it
I get off on this game

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn’t a game
Your life, I’ll swallow
And I can’t help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won

I look at you and start to crack
Start to crack
I give into, you take it back
Take it back
This lullaby is all you have
All you have
Sadistic pleasure, I attack
I attack
I attack
I attack
I attack

You wanted to play
The coldness follows
This isn’t a game
Your life, I’ll swallow
And I can’t help
But smile at your pain
You wanted to play
But I already won
I already won
I already won




Our lives are fake
They mean nothing, you see
Our dreams are lost
Just a fantasy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means nothing to me

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads

Our hearts are free
Does that mean anything?
Do what we’re told
Self-seeking hypocrisy
How many times have you been misguided?
How many times have your hopes been smited?
This life means fuck to me

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads

Black veil, it’s coming for me
It’s coming for me, it’s coming for me
It’s coming for me, it’s the black veil
Of insanity, it’s coming for me
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free, set free, set free, set free
Set free

Victimized, deceived
A black veil of insanity's crushing
Like fire beating all of our disease
The black veil of insanity misleads




What's it gonna be today?
Keep chipping at my soul
And why must it disobey?
The only thing I loathe.

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today.
I'm killing time.
Looking all around to find a way.
It's all wrong.
Knowing that my demon won.
I'm done!

Have I been lead astray?
Blaming the righteous.
What do you think they'd say?
Attacking the altar.

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today.
I'm killing time.
Looking all around to find a way.
It's all wrong.
Knowing that my demon won.
I'm done!

I'm done.

I'm done with faceless feelings.
I'm done with anything.
I'm done trying to support you
and sacrificing everything.

Everything, everything!

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today.
I'm killing time.
Looking all around to find a way.
It's all wrong.
Knowing that my demon won.
I'm done!




Why can't you ever back down?
Why can't you just shut your face?
Oh god the feelings I feel
Would get me thrown in a cage
You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away, I can't see
Lead the way, make them pay

Counting, on me.
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

You see the pain in my face
While you keep putting me down
Inside the rage starts to build
You push me I won't go down
You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your lives so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away, I can't see
Lead the way, make them pay

Counting, on me.
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave

Could it really be the day, today?
Could this really make the problems go away?
I'm going to hurt just not in time

Right now!
- I take in all I can now
Right Now!
- You've torn us all part
Right Now!
- There is nothing you can do to stop me
Right now [x9]

Counting, on me.
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
and in turn you're never there for me
You sucked the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
I always stay when I should leave [x2]




It looks like it's about to begin.
I'm lying down in a pool of sin now.
So why does it feel so good within?
Letting go, giving in!

Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Go away and never come back!

I'm gonna cry to dive right in.
I'm gonna fight until I win now.
I'm running down in a pool of sin.
Letting go, giving in!

Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Go away and never come back!

Never come back!
Never come back!
Go away and never come back!

Go away!
Go away!

Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Tell me what you want?
Tell me what you want?
Fuck you go away!
Go away and never come back!

Never come back!
Never come back!




The madness creeping up on me,
The pressure's building I foresee,
Alienation's lurking
Spawning lunacy.

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Misery often misleads.
It creates things we cannot see.
Excessive thoughts are bound
Distorting reality.

Slowly escaping
This carnage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Hello, are you there?
How come won't you listen?
I really don't care.
I really don't care.

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
Nothing will be the same.
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.




You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down

I'm good, I'm fine
This life's divine
No hate, no shame
No one to blame
You might despise
Your life with lies
I won't chastise
Even if you think you can

Bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me

I can't escape from the disdain
Your heart, your pain
Your drama is lame
Why can't you find
Some peace inside?
I won't chastise
Even when you think you can

Bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me

Hater [3x]
Hater [3x]

I'm good, I'm fine
This life's divine
No hate, no shame
No one to blame
Why can't you find
Some peace inside?

Hater [5x]

You can't bring me down
Already had my life turned upside down
I ride a downward spiral round and round
But I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me down

Hater [4x]
You won't ever bring me down
Hater [4x]
You won't ever bring me down
Hater [4x]
Cause I keep flying
I keep fighting
You won't ever bring me

Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me
Down [5x]
You won't ever bring me down




I feel the void 'cause I’m on a mission
I am no hero, I just have a vision
To liberate and destroy your system
The game is over, the game is over

I’m over it now, amusing the crowd
I’m willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I’m taking you down
I’m willing to die to see you fall

I am a threat to the opposition
I am no hero, I just have a vision
To terminate and restore this kingdom
The game is over, the game is over

I’m over it now, amusing the crowd
I’m willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I’m taking you down
I’m willing to die to see you fall

All I see while I’m dreaming
Is a man I wanna destroy
There’s no use for you hiding
I will be there behind every door

Are you prepared for the fighting?
'Cause I’m rising up, so fed up
I gave up on you long ago

I’m over it now, amusing the crowd
I’m willing to die to see you fall
Power unbound, I’m taking you down
I’m willing to die to see you fall

I’m over it now, amusing the crowd
I’m willing to die to see you fall
Over it now, amusing the crowd
I’m willing to die to see you fall




Cracked phone line
Means nothing
My brain's in fights and vain
My breathing
So shallow
It helps to curb the pain
What's outside?
Sneaks inside
How we contaminate
This warzone of my soul
I underestimate

I've never really thought about it that much
It's only ever violence that's in my touch
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way

The pills they, quit working
They take more than they give
Emotions on flat line
It's all that I can give
The rising
The falling
My mind keeps tricking me
It throws me a life raft
Then leaves me out at sea

I've never really thought about it that much
It's only ever violence that's in my touch
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way

I've never really thought about it that much
It's only ever violence that's in my touch
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way
Appears, appears, appears
I am built this way




Walking alone inside my world
Thinking I'm doing the right thing
Destroying all that appears before me
It was all done, in vein

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame

Taking this place to call my own
Raping my body without a face
Torching my soul as black as pitch
And I have no life to waste

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame

(I worshipped you
Do anything
So lost and helpless
I played your game)

I worshipped you (I worshipped you)
Do anything (Do anything)
So lost and helpless (So lost and helpless)
I PLAYED YOUR GAME!

Wanna get through fire
Wanna get through pain
Wanna get with violence
Wanna get with shame




I can remember when we first met  
we really had some times  
when the success started to kick in  
life turned into a mess  

Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  

You figured out really who I am  
you'll bet your life on that  
why can't you see me for what I am  
where human don't forget that (that)  

Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  

Stand around, don't follow me around  
playing me like a clown  
facing life not real (not real)  
life not real (not real)  
life not real (not real)  

Why can't we still be friends?  
Why judge me for what I am?  
Can we go back again?  
I'm still the same man.  

SAME man!! [4x]




I like the way you're so fucked up
Naked and wearing no makeup
I watch your pulse beneath your skin
Sometimes I wish I could crawl in
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you inside out
I like the way your lips contract
When you are lying on your back
The thrills and yells eternalize
The thoughts behind those crazy eyes
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you inside out
Bitch so untamed but outside it, a work of art
But underneath it you're beautiful when you're torn apart
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard
That's the fucking amazing shit the wish that makes you
Take the punishment to your heart as I squeeze it hard
I drink the milk that's in your breast
I wouldn't even mind your shit
I put my tongue inside your ear
I'm gonna eat you up right here
I don't care what you talk like
I don't care how you dress
I don't care 'bout your facial features
I couldn't care less
I don't need conversation
I've got nothing to say
I know what you're about
I want you, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out
Inside out, inside out




I wanna rock right now,  
I'm Rob Base and I came to get down  
I'm not internationally known,  
But I'm known to rock the microphone  
Because I get stupid, I mean outrageous,  
Stay away from me, if you're contagious,  
Cos' I'm a winner, no I'm not a loser  
To be an M.C. is what I choose-a.




You simply defy, I cannot even look to the sky, 
we try it single filed, take on me, and it's my denial, 
I cannot ever find, something safe, not done on the fly, 
I cannot live this way, floor and me will kick the P.A 
You wanna play with me 
I'm really gonna rock your world 
You want to comfort me 
I'm gonna rock your world 
You say everything is fine, I cannot compete with the skies, 
my sing has crossed the line, come in me, 
I fly through the sky, I can not ever find, 
you and me will make all the lines, oh, if they could see the plague, 
no one would want to be me 
You wanna play with me 
I'm really gonna rock your world 
You wanna comfort me 
I'm gonna rock your world 
So I fly 
Take me 
I cannot fly 
Most people hate me 
To fly away from this pain 
Please take away 
Please take away my P.A




Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws
I wanna do it
Let's draw straws
Jack said we should work together
Three of a kind
Birds of a feather
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, lock him up real tight
Throw away the key and then
Turn off all the lights

First, we're going to set some bait
Inside a nasty trap and wait
When he comes a-sniffing we will
Snap the trap and close the gate

Wait! I've got a better plan
To catch this big red lobster man
Let's pop him in a boiling pot
And when he's done we'll butter him up

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Throw him in a box
Bury him for ninety years
Then see if he talks

Cuz Mr. Oogie Boogie man
Can take the whole thing over then
He'll be so pleased I do declare
That he will cook him rare

I say that we take a cannon
Aim it at his door and then
Knock three times and when he answers
Sandy Claws will be no more

You're so stupid, think now
If we blow him up into smithereens
We may lose some pieces
And the Jack will beat us black and green

Kidnap the Sandy Claws
Tie him in a bag
Throw him in the ocean
Then see if he is sad

Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around
If I were on his Boogie list, I'd get out of town

He'll be so pleased by our success
That he'll reward us too, I bet

Perhaps he'll make his special brew
Of snake and spider stew
Yummm!

We're his little henchmen
And we take our job with pride
We do our best to please him
And stay on his good side

I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb
I'm not the dumb one
You're no fun
Shut up!

I've got something, listen now
This one is real good, you'll see
We'll send a present to his door
Upon there'll be a note to read
Now, in the box we'll wait and hide

Until his curiosity
Entices him to look inside
And then we'll have him
One, two, three

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, beat him with a stick
Lock him for ninety years, see what makes him tick

Kidnap the Sandy Claws, chop him into bits
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks
Kidnap the Sandy Claws, see what we will see
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the key

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la




Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage and fear I feel 
Pain and rage

Once more pain is thrown my way
Can't she stay away
Every single time
Fucking with my mind
Built up all this rage
Trapped inside some cage
While she sits and smiles

Layla
Layla

Inside I'm afraid
Afraid of who I am
Tell me is this real
I'm a government

I have fought to find a way
I am afraid
To be who I am

Fuck

Layla
Layla

That's why I cry
This lie I drown




Lodi Dodi, we likes to party
We don't cause trouble
We don't bother nobody
'Cause we're just some kids who on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic, we rock the mic right.




Feeling really out of place
Simply have too much time
Alone for a lifetime searching for
Things I will never find
I am here to take
Whatever I feel is mine
I'm feeling like I'm never needed
Walking alone blind...
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.
Looking at another face
Looking for another sign
Alone in my bed wasted without fear
Waiting for my time
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.
I don't understand here
Why God would do me this way
I've lived a life
Was always good
The one thing I need, ya take away
Ya take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
(The one thing) take away (YA TAKE AWAY!)
AWAY!
AWAY!
Ya took away my world
All ya left was pain
And all this time is for nothing
Once upon a time
I never thought I'd end up dead
Horrid thoughts dance in my head
From time to time
Oh once upon a time
Feeling like I'm on a plane that's going down.




Must you keep looking at me

Must you keep glaring at me

What's your lie? 

Warm lips, a fake smile, has made your mind runs wild, 
this game you play I like the way 
You expect to grab a child, you think I'm innocent, 
not wild, take me and look see how much I'm tame 

Never gotta a little, but I think he'll never know, 
how to live with sure body wild until the pressure so, 
I'll show you feelings that you pain is nothing, 
so let your body hang in there, what a frustrating fear 

Warm lips, a big smile, hatred runs through your insides, 
this game you play intimidation each day
You think it's all a lie, they want you to stray outta line, 
anger twisted your life, but you pay 

I wish I could take control, 
I wish I could let go, 
I wish I could break this mold, 
inside I'm so fucking cold 

I'm come'n 
I'm come'n 
I'm come'n on you 

Warm lips, a fake smile
Has made your mind run wild,

I wish I could lose control,

You can see I fly  
Disguised evil attracting everybody  
You can watch me play  
Taste your juices from me all day  

You can see I tried this all for you  
You can see I dispise all of you  
You can see I'm trying something new  
You can see me fly  

[CHORUS]
Sometime, somewhere  
Deceit leads you no where  
You try so hard  
To be the (super star?)  

So come in with me  
Take your under sun light set you free  
Somewhere can't you see  
Going on this way  
Free you'll never be  

So you see I tried this all for you  
So you see I dispise all of you  
So you see I'm trying something new  
So you see me fly  

[CHORUS]

Just take me away  
Take me away (Take me)  
Take me  

[CHORUS]

Take me away..  

Take.. me.. away...




This Broken Soul

I, I can't remember the day, when I lie and cried
I miss the time, the day, though I try,
to hide it from you, this broken soul, I can't deny, arms growin cold
Nowhere to run, no one to hold me

This Broken Soul

I still remember the way,
how you smiled as I cried, you laughed,
I bled everyday, I could never get away from you
This broken soul, I can't deny, arms growin so cold,
nowhere to run, no one to hold me

This Broken Soul

No one to hold me

I can't remember when,
you and I we walk as friends
never seen, a foolish idea
How can these lies be a good bye now
I, I will find,
you in my way,
a different pain,
took inside of me,
I will find [x4]
you in my way, a different pain
took the pride of me, one I'll never hold,

This Broken Soul

Too late I'm dead, reposition, plenty, extraction
Demanding the best psychiatrist, psychic soothsayers (soothsayers)
Analyzing my instincts, you got I all figured out
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, you should have said
I would have hung around a little longer
Too late I'm dead, you should have said
I would have hung around a little longer, too late I'm dead
Fuck everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Done everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Fuck everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Known everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Too late, I'm dead, I made my bed, you should too
Belong right beside me, the beast is mad, the patient's hanging out
The trees have all burnt to the ground in this vicinity
It's a strange retribution to be lying here, so close to what I despise
Fuck everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Done everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Fuck everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Known everything, everything, everything
How could you love someone with what they've done?
Now
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead
Too late I'm dead, too late I'm dead, too late




Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house,
everybody was stoned, even the mouse 
Man from the courthouse, and me from jail, I just settled down, 
to get a piece of her tail 
When all of a sudden, I heard such a clatter, I tripped on my dick, 
and busted my bladder 
I went downstairs, and what did i see, a fat little red fagget, 
hanging from a tree 
He stuffed the stockings, with reefers and beer, and a big fat hairy dick, 
for the family queer 
That's the end of my story, funny wasn't it, you see 
She didn't even... 
She didn't see my thing behind you, leave you for this private eye, 
I was there to give'em near to my, zima zima mommy fah, 
I'm gonna say this, hope it don't offend you, came to the grizma,
give'em a taste of me, give'em a little excitement to the damn monkey, 
your monkey can stay with me, 

ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
ahhhh 
ahhhhhhhh 

Chevy took my brain, same old motherfucker sucked my dick that day, 
he will never zima zima, never never not that day, 
I'm really sick of all this excitement, yeah, 
but he thinks he's better than me, uma zooma nooga dunga, 
you can suck my dick all day, one, two, three, four, 
Santa can suck my dick all day




Woke up, didn't choke up 
Saw my AK, it was broke up 
Put it together like a jigsaw 
Got my nine and my rambo knife off the floor 
Went to the bathroom and beat the rush 
"Yo who the fuck used my toothbrush?" 

Went to my sister's room, "Yo, bitch wake up" 
"You stupid ass, dirty ass, nasty ass slut" 
Shot her in the leg, shot her in the thigh 
Kicked her in the pussy, and punched her in the eye 
Slapped her in the head, stepped on her cord 
Don't fuck around bitch word is bond 

Went downstairs to eat with my folks 
"Ma... you broke the fuckin' egg yolk" 
Punched her in the chest, got on her cheek 
Then I made her scream like the bitch was a thief 
Knee to the pussy, kick to the skull 
AK yo I shot the bitch in the temple 
Pops' got mad cuz Mom got licked 
I didn't give a fuck so I shot 'em in the dick 
Hungry ass fuck, said my grace 
Pop kept screamin' so I shot him in the face 
Ate my food found my coat 

Mail man came so I cut his mutha-fuckin' throat 
Waiting for the mutha-fuckin' school bus... 
I had a dream that I was hard.....
